The rain poured relentlessly over the techno-campus, a labyrinth of steel and neon where students wandered like specters pursuing their digital destinies. Against this backdrop, Alex, a quiet sophomore with a penchant for vintage films, found refuge in the library's dimly lit corners. Yet, it was not celluloid dreams that preoccupied him today but a more immediate concern—the inadequate first aid kit stashed carelessly in his backpack. 

"Why carry that around, Alex?" Mia's voice cut through the murmur of distant rain. She often visited him during lunch breaks, a brilliant hacker whose nimble fingers seemed to manipulate the very strings of fate on the school's networks. Today, her usual vivacity was tempered by concern. 

"In case of emergencies," Alex replied with a soft smile, knowing all too well the limitations of his preparedness. "You never know when you'll need some gauze and bandages."

"Or, in this world, a cybernetic limb," Mia quipped, her eyes glinting with a paradoxical mixture of mirth and melancholy. 

Their conversations, rich with banter and buried truths, often treaded into the realms of hypothetical possibilities, drifting from mundane school life into the speculative echoes of Philip K. Dick's dystopian visions—which they both admired.

"Do you ever think about what it means to be human, in this place?" Alex asked, gesturing around him. The pink and turquoise lights cast eerie shadows on their faces.

Mia paused, her gaze intense yet distant, deciphering an unspoken language that only the two seemed to understand. "It's easy to forget, with all this tech... Sometimes, it feels like our humanity is just something we download and upload."

"But what if we lose that file one day?" Alex's question lingered, touching on their shared anxiety—the balancing act of maintaining their essence amidst the cold sprawl of technology.

As the clock ticked, a familiar tension arose, the kind that spoke of unfinished business. Alex knew that the reality of the insufficient first aid kit was more than just a metaphor; it was a symbol of their vulnerability within an environment that promised advancement but often delivered isolation.

The bell rang, its chime merging with the sound of rain. They parted ways with a silent promise to reconvene, unspoken words filling the gap between them.

A week later, chaos erupted during a routine class inspection of a drone delivery gone awry. Wires sparked, and the air turned acrid with the scent of burning circuits. Amid the confusion, a panicked scream rang out—Mia had been caught in the malfunction.

Alex rushed to her side, heart pounding against the walls of his chest. The inadequate first aid kit felt like a cruel joke now, its meager contents an impossible solution to an overwhelming crisis. He could only offer his presence, his helpless fingers brushing against her own in a futile attempt to bridge the inevitable.

In their final conversation, words became weightless and transient. "It wasn't supposed to end like this," Mia whispered, the light in her eyes a vivid contrast to the encroaching dark.

And in that moment, Alex understood the profundity of their shared fear: the fragility of life, the longing for meaningful connections, the irrevocability of loss. Echoes of their laughter, their musings on humanity, resonated in the neon halls long after they were no more—an indelible mark on the fabric of their futuristic school, a poignant reminder that even in a cybernetic age, some wounds could never be healed by the scant offerings of a first aid kit.
