In the small village of Xiangjie, time stretched languidly like an endless summer siesta. Beneath the lazy sun, a peculiar tree stood at the heart of the village square. Its leaves shimmered like emeralds, a generous spectacle, yet its true marvel was the fruit it bore—the universally enigmatic nuts, known only as "普遍的nuts."

Rumors ebbed and flowed through Xiangjie like tides. Whispers claimed that these nuts held the power to unveil human nature in its rawest form, a reflection of one's deepest truth. No one dared to test this tale until one day, when a wanderer named Kuan stumbled into Xiangjie.

Kuan, with eyes that mirrored the sky at twilight and a voice as smooth as morning dew, had traversed countless lands. Intrigued by whispers of the nuts’ enigma, he found himself drawn to the peculiar tree. 

“Kuan, what do you seek here?" asked Mei, the village elder, her voice crackling like worn parchment.

"Truth," Kuan replied simply, a hint of amusement in his smile. "I heard these nuts show one's deepest self. Is that not a gift worth seeking?"

Mei chuckled, a sound like wind rustling through ancient pages. "Careful, boy. The truth isn’t always a friend."

Yet Kuan, undeterred by warnings, reached for a nut. Its shell gleamed under the sun, innocent yet foreboding. The villagers gathered, breaths held, as Kuan cracked the shell and consumed the kernel within. 

Moments passed, pregnant with anticipation, when Kuan's eyes grew wide, his expression transforming to one of vivid horror. He stumbled backward, clasping his head, as though he'd peered into the abyss and seen himself staring back.

"What is it?" asked Li, a young farmer with broad shoulders and eyes full of sincerity. He pushed through the murmur of the crowd, concern knitted across his brow.

Kuan stammered, "I saw... I saw everything. Every desire, every fear, all stripped bare. It is maddening!"

"But were they not your own truths?" Mei inquired, her voice woven with both understanding and wry amusement.

Kuan nodded, still dazed. "And that..." he paused, his words a confessional hymn, "is the madness of it all. Such is the weight of being."

The villagers whispered among themselves, each secretly contemplating their own unseen truths. Yet none dared follow Kuan's path; the dread of self-confrontation clutched at their hearts like iron chains.

Exasperated, Kuan departed, his quest for truth transformed into an intimate, haunting dance with madness. The villagers resumed their routines, every now and then glancing at the mythical tree, questioning its place in their world.

Life in Xiangjie continued, unchanged yet irrevocably altered, a testament to humanity's eternal dance with self-awareness—a cosmic jest wrapped in the guise of a simple nut.

And thus, the universally enigmatic nuts remained an untouched whisper in the heart of Xiangjie, a silent satire of humanity's universal fear of its own depths.
