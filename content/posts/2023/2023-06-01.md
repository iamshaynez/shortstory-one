The train station hummed with the quiet frenzy of people heading somewhere, heads tilted, minds elsewhere. Julian stood by the vending machine, gazing at the blinking selection. He turned as he heard footsteps approachingâ€”it was Lila, punctual as a town clock.

"Coffee still tastes like someone else's memory," she said, skipping formalities.

"And just as bitter," Julian added, slipping a coin into the slot, not bothering to make a selection.

"What brings you here?" Lila's voice carried the weight of suspicion, curiosity sharp enough to slice through silence.

"A toothbrush," he replied, the word floating between them like a missing piece of an unsolved puzzle.

"Direct as ever. But you don't expect truth's veil to lift with such simple logic, do you?" She arched an eyebrow, her skepticism both a challenge and a shield.

He shrugged, "Sometimes, simple's your way out. Simple as a toothbrush."

Lila shook her head, braided hair swinging like the last pendulum call of a forgotten clock. "It's been three years since the trial, since they snapped sentences like bones in a sentencing room. You think a toothbrush can clean that?"

Julian chuckled, a deep, sandpaper sound. "Cleans my teeth at least. Keeps me thinking straight." His words leaned heavy on the unsaid, a bridge between history and present.

They moved to a bench, worn wood creaking under the combined weight of their burdens. Julian looked at the platform's edge. "I always thought I'd meet him again. Here."

Lila pulled out a cigarette, twirling it between fingers. The habit was long abandoned, but rituals die hard. "Do you still believe he didn't do it?"

"Truth's a lot like a switched track," Julian mused, his eyes losing focus on the concrete floor. "Sometimes, what's direct doesn't match where it takes you."

"Still reasoning it out the old way, like pushing a boulder uphill."

He nodded, an imperceptible flash of something deep within. "Bitter exercises make for fit mind, they say."

The board flickered, announcing the arrival of a train. They sat in silence, sound filling the void with echoes of whispered secrets and clipped confessions.

"I often wonder what it would have been like if he'd just caught that last train," Lila said, voice soft, as if afraid of the possibilities her words conjured.

"Choices are nothing but ghosts of roads not taken," Julian replied, eyes hardening with the memories of a courtroom's sterile lights, the judge's relentless gavel. "Time's just weathered down our chances."

"And what's left?" she asked, looking for a place for hope to nest.

"What's left is us, trying to scrub clean with a simple toothbrush in an impossibly dirty world," Julian sighed, resolution as sharp as resignation.

The train hushed into the station like a long-held breath, a serpentine monster of metal and steam. As passengers began to spill out, Julian stood up, a silhouette against a dimming world.

"Will you stay?" Lila asked, clutching at the vestiges of connection.

"No," he said, stepping into the train, offering her a faint, bittersweet smile. "This train's not my answer."

As the train pulled away, Lila watched Julian dissolve into the horizon's gray scales, hope's residue slipping like sand through an open hand.

Alone on the station, she whispered the last words, lost in echoes against the hard, indifferent tracks. "Some things you just can't clean."

And the station continued its hum, untouched and unchanged, a testament to lives threaded swiftly, inevitably apart.
