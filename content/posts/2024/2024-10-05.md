"There's something wrong with that shower," Mama whispered, her weathered hands trembling as she clutched her coffee mug. The morning light filtering through the dusty windows of our Mississippi farmhouse cast long shadows across her face.

I'd heard the same warning every day since moving back home to care for her. The ancient plumbing had always been temperamental, but Mama's paranoia about the upstairs bathroom had grown worse since Daddy passed.

"Now Mama," I said, trying to sound patient. "We've been through this. It's just old pipes."

She shook her head violently, gray curls bouncing. "No, Caroline. You don't understand. That shower... it speaks to me. Whispers things. Terrible things."

I sighed, remembering how the dementia had started creeping in last winter. The doctors said to humor her delusions, but it broke my heart to see her this way.

"What kind of things does it whisper?" I asked gently.

Her pale blue eyes went wide. "It knows secrets. Dark ones. About what really happened to your daddy."

A chill ran down my spine despite the oppressive summer heat. Daddy's death had been ruled an accident - a fall down those narrow stairs leading to the second floor. But sometimes I caught Mama staring at that staircase with such guilt in her eyes...

That night, I lay awake listening to the old house settle. A steady drip-drip-drip echoed from upstairs. Probably just a loose washer. But there was something else... a faint whisper, like radio static.

Against my better judgment, I crept up to investigate. The bathroom door stood slightly ajar, tendrils of steam curling out despite no one having used the shower. As I reached for the handle, I heard it - a voice, gurgling and wet:

"Caroline... I know you can hear me..."

My hand froze. That voice... it sounded like Daddy.

"Your mama... she pushed me. Right here, by this shower. We were arguing about her condition, about putting her in a home. She didn't mean to. But she did it all the same..."

I stumbled backward, heart pounding. This couldn't be real. And yet...

The next morning, I found Mama already at the kitchen table, hands steady for the first time in months as she sipped her coffee.

"You heard it too, didn't you?" she asked quietly. "Now you understand."

I looked at her - really looked at her. Behind the fog of dementia, I saw clarity in her eyes. And grief. And relief.

"Yes, Mama," I said, sitting beside her. "I understand now."

She reached for my hand. "I've been carrying that secret so long... waiting for someone else to hear the truth. That shower - it's been my penance. My confessor."

"We'll face it together," I promised, squeezing her fingers. "No more secrets."

That afternoon, we called the police. Mama told them everything, calm and clear-headed. They were kind, understanding about her condition and the accident's nature. No charges were filed.

The whispers from the shower stopped after that. Sometimes a loose washer still drips, but that's all it is now - just old pipes in an old house, finally at peace with its secrets.

Mama started getting better after her confession. The fog lifted gradually. While the doctors can't explain it, I know the truth: sometimes the most reliable witness to our sins isn't our conscience, but the silent observers in our daily lives - even if it's just an old shower, waiting patiently to wash away our guilt.
