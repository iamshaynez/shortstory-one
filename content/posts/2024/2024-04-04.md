"I think my sofa is trying to dissolve me," Sarah declared matter-of-factly to her therapist, Dr. Fleming. The elderly man adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses, maintaining his characteristic poker face that had weathered countless unusual proclamations over his thirty years of practice.

"That's quite an assertion," he responded carefully. "What makes you think so?"

Sarah shifted uncomfortably in the leather armchair. "It started three weeks ago. Every time I sit on it, I feel this... burning sensation. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but then I noticed my clothes were becoming threadbare exactly where they touched the fabric."

Dr. Fleming leaned forward slightly. "And you believe the sofa is... acidic?"

"I know how it sounds," Sarah laughed nervously, running her fingers through her copper hair. "But here's the thing - I inherited that sofa from my grandmother. It's the last piece of her I have left."

"Tell me about your grandmother."

"She was... corrosive," Sarah smiled wryly. "She had this way of dissolving pretenses, stripping away the layers people built around themselves. Sometimes it hurt, but it always revealed something true underneath."

The therapist nodded thoughtfully. "And now you're experiencing something similar with her sofa?"

"Maybe that's why I can't bring myself to get rid of it," Sarah mused. "Every time it burns, it reminds me of her brutal honesty. How she'd say things like 'Dear, that relationship is eating away at you' or 'That job is corroding your soul.'"

"Your grandmother sounds like she was quite the existentialist," Dr. Fleming observed. "She understood that discomfort often precedes authentic living."

Sarah's eyes widened. "Yes! She used to say that comfort was just another word for complacency. That we need to feel the burn sometimes to remember we're alive."

"And how do you feel when you sit on this acidic sofa?"

"Strangely... present," Sarah admitted. "Like I can't hide from myself anymore. It forces me to move, to shift perspectives, to... exist more deliberately."

Dr. Fleming smiled for the first time. "Perhaps your grandmother left you more than just furniture. She left you a reminder - that growth often comes with a sting, that truth can be caustic, but necessary."

Sarah stood up, a new light in her eyes. "I think I understand now. The sofa isn't trying to dissolve me - it's dissolving the barriers I've built around myself."

"Will you keep it then?"

"Yes," Sarah said firmly. "But I'm going to put it in my study instead of my living room. Sometimes we need a designated space for uncomfortable truths."

As she left his office, Dr. Fleming watched her go with quiet satisfaction. He'd seen many patients struggle with inherited objects before, but this was the first time one had transformed a seemingly destructive legacy into a tool for self-discovery.

That evening, Sarah sat on her grandmother's sofa, feeling the familiar burn. But this time, instead of shifting away, she settled deeper into it, embracing the discomfort as an old friend. The acid of truth, she realized, only dissolved what needed to fall away.
