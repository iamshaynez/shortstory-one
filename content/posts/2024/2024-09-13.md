"The candles are dying," Maria whispered, her voice echoing through the twisted corridors of chrome and shadow. The dim flames flickered against metallic walls that seemed to pulse with some ancient technological heartbeat.

I watched her delicate fingers trace patterns in the air, leaving ephemeral trails of blue light. "They've been dying for centuries," I replied. "Or maybe just minutes. Time doesn't work the same way here."

We'd entered the labyrinth three days ago – or was it three years? The chronometer on my wrist had begun spinning wildly the moment we crossed the threshold, its digital display showing impossible dates and times.

"Do you remember why we came?" Maria asked, her eyes reflecting the dancing candlelight. She looked both young and ancient, a paradox wrapped in human form.

"To find the Archive," I said, though the words felt hollow. "The greatest repository of human knowledge ever created. But now I'm not sure if we're searching for it, or if it's searching for us."

A soft chuckle escaped her lips. "Listen to yourself, David. You sound like one of those old books we used to read. The ones about recursive dreams and infinite libraries."

"Maybe those weren't fiction after all." I held up my candle, watching shadows leap and twist across the corridor ahead. "Have you noticed how the walls keep changing? Not just their configuration, but their very nature?"

Maria nodded. "Glass to steel to stone and back again. As if the labyrinth is trying different shapes, different materials, different realities."

"Like it's learning?"

"Or remembering."

We turned another corner and found ourselves in a vast circular chamber. Thousands of candles lined the walls, their flames perfectly still despite the impossible breeze that tugged at our clothes.

"I've seen this room before," Maria said.

"We both have. Multiple times."

"But it's different now, isn't it?" She approached one of the walls, her hand hovering near the flames. "The candles... they're not just providing light. They're storing something. Information maybe, or memories."

I joined her, studying the neat rows of flickering light. "Each flame a data point in some vast cosmic calculation."

"David," Maria's voice had changed, taken on an edge of revelation. "What if we're not in a labyrinth at all? What if this is the Archive itself?"

Before I could respond, all the candles except ours suddenly extinguished. The darkness that rushed in wasn't mere absence of light – it had weight, presence, purpose.

"Maria?" I called out, but her candlelight had vanished too.

In the absolute darkness, my single flame seemed to grow brighter. In its light, I saw the walls dissolving, revealing endless lines of code, mathematical formulas, and fragments of human history streaming past.

"The Archive isn't a place," Maria's voice came from everywhere and nowhere. "We're inside humanity's collective memory. And it's waking up."

My candle flickered once, and
