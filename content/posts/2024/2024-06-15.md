In a world where video games had been banned for decades, old Wei kept his ancient gaming console hidden beneath loose floorboards, treating it like a sacred relic. The device, covered in a fine layer of dust, still hummed to life each night when the old man carefully extracted it from its hiding place.

"You see, little one," Wei whispered to his granddaughter Mei, his wrinkled face illuminated by the soft blue glow of the screen, "this is what joy used to look like."

Mei's eyes widened as pixelated characters danced across the screen. In their stark concrete apartment, where entertainment was strictly regulated, this forbidden window into the past felt magical.

"But Grandpa, why do their faces look so happy? The Education Bureau says games corrupt the soul," Mei whispered, unable to tear her eyes away from the colorful display.

Wei chuckled, a sound like autumn leaves rustling. "That's what they want you to believe. But these games - they taught us hope, creativity, perseverance. Each failure was just another chance to try again."

As Wei spoke these words, something strange began to happen. The pixelated characters seemed to step out of the screen, their blocky forms taking on an ethereal glow as they danced around the room. Mei gasped, but felt no fear - only wonder.

"Are they... ghosts?" she asked, reaching out to touch a glowing figure that resembled a mushroom with eyes.

"Memory echoes," Wei corrected, his voice taking on a dreamy quality. "The joy of millions of players, crystallized into light. They appear sometimes, when someone remembers the true spirit of gaming."

The figures continued their dance, casting dancing shadows on the walls. A plumber jumped impossible heights, a hedgehog spun in bright blue circles, warriors and wizards enacted epic battles in silence.

"But why show me now, Grandpa?"

Wei's expression grew serious. "Because they're coming tomorrow, little one. The final sweep. They'll take everything that's left of the old world. But they can't take what we remember."

That night, as the ghostly games played out their endless loops around them, Wei taught Mei every game he could remember. She learned of princesses in other castles, of quests for truth through digital labyrinths, of worlds where failure meant only a chance to press 'continue.'

When morning came, the enforcement officers found only an old man and his granddaughter, sitting quietly in an empty room. They never found the console - it had dissolved into light with the last ghost-sprite at dawn.

Years later, Mei would tell her own children about the night the games came alive. Some dismissed it as fantasy, but those who listened closely might notice: in the corners of their vision, sometimes, a pixelated hero would flash past, carrying with it an echo of joy from a more optimistic time.

And in those moments, if one listened very carefully, they might hear old Wei's voice: "Press start to continue."
