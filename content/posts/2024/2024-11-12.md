In the shaded alcoves of Jiangnan University, whispers of impending summer break danced alongside the rustle of foliage. The campus, both vast and intimate, was like a tapestry where destinies wove with strings both thick and thin. Within this bristling world of ambition and silent yearning, Mei found herself an odd blend of observer and participant. 

Mei was a reserved young woman, her eyes often dipped in the comfort of books, more at ease among the tales of yore than the constant pulse of student life. She sat, as usual, on a sun-warmed bench by the ancient banyan, fingers tracing the spine of a Tolstoy novel, the very essence of storytelling that she admired yet felt distanced from.

Jiawei, charismatic and enigmatic, was the antithesis of Mei’s quietude. He navigated the campus with a sneakered elegance, reminiscent of a fox in human guise, evoking smiles and gentle laughs from all he encountered. Yet for Mei, his charm held mystery much like a cautionary tale unspun.

Their paths intertwined unexpectedly during an innocuous afternoon, the catalyst a fleeting mishap. Mei, lost in her thoughts, wandered into Jiawei's football match, resulting in an unexpected collision that sent her book tumbling. Jiawei, adept and quick, secured the book mid-air, offering his hand to Mei. "Tolstoy, huh? Always about grand stories," he remarked, a playful glint in his eyes.

"Yes," Mei replied, brushing dirt from her skirt. "Grand stories wrapped in the bandages of the human spirit.”

Jiawei laughed, a sound like water over stones. "Bandages, indeed. But sometimes even those stories need new endings, don’t you think?"

That simple exchange sparked a conversation about their shared fascination with narratives, though their interpretations differed. Jiawei saw them as mere skeletons, waiting to be clothed anew, while Mei preferred to unwrap their layers painstakingly, fearing what the modern might distort. As campus life flowed around them, their dialogue deepened, revealing how both were akin in seeking unspoken truths within the presumptive normalcy of their environment.

Days passed, their conversations became a sanctuary amidst academic routines, each word a thread pulling them closer to unseen revelations. Mei, with cautious courage, began to share her own stories, small vignettes about her childhood, her fears, dreams she once thought cliché. Meanwhile, Jiawei spoke candidly of an impending decision, one he had avoided through every dodge of the soccer ball and every lighthearted jest—the choice to pursue a traditional career path or embrace his passion for storytelling, a journey fraught with uncertain paths.

Mei’s quiet support and insight prompted Jiawei to re-examine his future. These exchanges grew into a silent pact of encouragement against the oppressive structures of expectation that loomed over their university days.

On the eve of their parting, as summer beckoned everyone homeward, Jiawei handed Mei an envelope. "Open it when you've forgotten all the words I’ve said," he winked, vanishing into a sea of farewells.

Weeks later, under a distant sky, Mei’s fingers trembled as she opened the envelope. Inside lay a simple note penned with care: “I chose my own ending.” 

And thus, Mei realized that their dialogues hadn't just been conversations but turning points, not for Jiawei alone but for her own silent story as well. The campus, the conversations, all the fabric of time they shared—it was a narrative she hadn’t realized was co-authored.

It was a traditional story, wrapped in bandages of subtle reflections and realized truths, carrying the promise of continuations yet unwritten, a testament to the unpredictable prose of life.
