The sunlight poured through the dusty window of the crumbling apothecary, dim as if nature itself acknowledged the weary spell clinging to the room. Sergei Alekseyevich shuffled cards at the corner table, his chipped fingernails scratching the wood with each mechanical motion. He wasn’t playing with anyone—no one came to play cards anymore. His sole companion, a tarnished knife on the table, its edge blunt, laid motionless as if detesting its very purpose.

"I could forgive hunger," Sergei muttered as if the knife were a person, "but meaninglessness… never."  

His voice broke the silence carefully curated by decades of isolation. Sergei, once a promising historian, had exiled himself here after seeing history's cyclical cruelty—empires rising and collapsing like drunken men staggering through eternity. Knowledge, he had decided, wasn't salvation but shackles. Why dissect the past when the future remained indifferent?

A man loved his knives. Sergei once loved this one too, valued it as a tool—sharp, purposeful, the mark of his utility. But now, it sat unused, its steel graying like everything else in this world.

A bell tinkled. A visitor.

Into the room stepped Maria Afanasyevna, her boots kissed with mud, her dark shawl a patchwork of snowy wool and inexplicable mystery. Her movements were slow yet deliberate, her gaze heavy-lidded, as though pulled down by burdens invisible to Sergei.

"A historian in hiding?" Her voice crawled out, soft but serrated with sarcasm. It matched her eyes—more curious than kind. She laid down a small satchel and unwrapped a canister of tea leaves as though presenting him with gold. A quiet offering, one meant to bruise its recipient’s pride while also softening his cynicism.

Sergei eyed her suspiciously. "What makes you think I care for visitors?"

"I don't," Maria replied simply, pouring hot water from her kettle into two cracked cups. "But even the most hollow men hold a spark, Sergei." She sat opposite him, staring at the knife.

Her focus unnerved him. “That old thing? It’s but a relic now. It serves no purpose.”

Maria tilted her head, her dark, braided hair catching the light in serpentine patterns. "A knife doesn’t lose its purpose. It merely waits for its wielder to remember."

"History disagrees," Sergei scoffed, folding his arms. His voice had an edge now, a defensive sharpness. "History is the record of men wielding instruments without understanding if they should. Swords, guns, knives—all symbols of doom."

"Symbols cut both ways," she countered. She picked up the knife with disrespectful ease and traced her thumb along its dulled edge. "It is not the knife that chooses its meaning, but the hand wielding it. It is only 'doom' to men like you, who’ve lost the courage to use it."  

Sergei straightened, his skin flushing with the itch of her rebuke. "Men who obsess over courage pretend they do not see how the world chews us up. You come here quoting lies about purpose, yet what do *you* truly believe? What is *your* history?"

Her lips curved, not entirely in condescension. "My history," Maria said, leaning back, "is one written in margins. The daughter of serfs, the wife of a nothing man who fought in wars he didn’t understand. I have burned houses to keep myself alive. And each flame was not hesitation but choice."

Silence descended again. Sergei refused to speak first. But Maria wasn’t bothered by the quiet. She drank her tea slowly, savoring it in a way that pricked at his numbness.

"You’re a coward," she said at last, with the softness of a friend driving a dagger into the heart. "History frightens you because understanding it leaves no room for excuses."

He slammed his fist against the table. The knife in her grip rattled in response, as though awakening. "And what choice do I have?" he demanded. "Tell me, Maria, what does a man do when he fears there’s no truth behind the mask he wears?"

Maria smiled faintly, returning the knife to the table. Her gaze flicked once more to it—a lifeless blade yet brimming with unsaid possibilities. "He does what he's most afraid to: he takes it up again."

Her words seemed to scrape the room hollow. Sergei stared at the knife, its steel unnervingly reflective. In that distorted surface, he saw not his face but his past—the historian, the son, the man who once believed knowledge gave freedom.  

And then he saw nothing at all.

Later, whether hours or merely minutes, Sergei wasn’t sure, Maria was gone. She had left the kettle steaming, but the knife stayed on the table. Its weight haunted him—or perhaps it was his own hand, trembling as it reached for the handle once more.

Later scholars would write of Sergei Alekseyevich’s return to the city—not as a leader of men, nor as a savior, but as a quiet scribe who chronicled his nation’s pain with unrelenting honesty. *"The coward,"* they would call him, *"who dared to survive in an unbearable world."*

And the knife? It rested in his drawer, unused. But its silence was no longer resentment. It was peace.
