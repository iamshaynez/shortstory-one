"A perfectly square scale," Detective Morgan muttered, carefully examining the metallic object on his desk. "What an peculiar piece of evidence."

The scale in question had been discovered at the scene of wealthy businessman James Crawford's murder. It was an unusual item - exactly square in shape, with precise measurements etched along its edges.

"Tell me again what you observed, Ms. Peters," Morgan addressed the victim's secretary, who sat nervously across from him.

"Well," she began, fidgeting with her pearl necklace, "Mr. Crawford was incredibly particular about his measurements. He had various scales and measuring devices in his office. But I've never seen this square one before."

"Interesting." Morgan leaned back. "And who else had access to his office?"

"Only three people besides myself - his wife Eleanor, his business partner Mr. Chen, and the cleaning lady, Mrs. Rodriguez."

Morgan's eyes narrowed. "And where were each of them yesterday evening between 7 and 9 PM?"

"Mrs. Crawford was at her book club - several witnesses can confirm. Mr. Chen was supposedly working late at the office, though I left before he did. As for Mrs. Rodriguez, she always cleans the executive floor on Thursday evenings."

"Detective!" Officer Zhang burst into the room. "Lab results are in. The scale shows traces of the poison used to kill Mr. Crawford."

Morgan smiled slightly. "Just as I suspected. Please bring in Mr. Chen."

Twenty minutes later, a well-dressed Asian man entered, appearing completely composed.

"Mr. Chen," Morgan began, "would you explain why you've been importing these specialized square scales from overseas?"

Chen's fa√ßade cracked slightly. "I... don't know what you mean."

"These scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine to measure precise amounts of herbs. Some of which, when combined incorrectly, create lethal poisons." Morgan placed the scale on the table between them. "Like the one that killed your partner."

"You can't prove anything," Chen said stiffly.

"Actually, we can. You see, this scale has microscopic markings unique to your family's manufacturing company. The same company that Crawford was planning to sell off, against your wishes."

Chen's composure finally broke. "He was going to destroy generations of my family's work! Everything we built together - he would throw it away for profit!"

Morgan signaled to the officers waiting outside. "Mr. Chen, you're under arrest for the murder of James Crawford."

As Chen was led away, Ms. Peters turned to Morgan. "How did you know to focus on the scale?"

"In my experience, Ms. Peters, murderers often leave behind something personal - something that connects them to their true nature. Mr. Chen's cultural background and family business gave him both the means and the motive. The square scale was his signature, whether he intended it or not."

She nodded thoughtfully. "I suppose even the most careful killers can't help but leave traces of themselves behind."

"Indeed." Morgan carefully placed the scale into an evidence bag. "In the end, it's often the smallest details that tell the biggest stories."

As he watched Ms. Peters leave, Morgan allowed himself a small smile. The scale had told its story - but perhaps not quite the whole truth. After all, there was still the matter of those pearl necklace fragments found near Crawford's body...
