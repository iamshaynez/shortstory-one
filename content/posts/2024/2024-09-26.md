The rhythmic drone of the weed wacker penetrated through Sarah's office window, disrupting her concentration for the third time that week. She glanced outside, where the groundskeeper, Mr. Chen, methodically trimmed the corporate campus lawn with his battered orange machine. The afternoon sun caught its scratched surface, revealing years of faithful service through countless seasons.

"That awful noise again," muttered Diana from the adjacent cubicle, her manicured fingers drumming impatiently on her ergonomic keyboard. "I can't believe they won't invest in quieter equipment. It's so... unseemly."

Sarah observed how Diana's nose wrinkled slightly at the sight of Mr. Chen's weathered uniform, stained with grass clippings and bearing the marks of honest labor. The same expression she wore during budget meetings when discussing maintenance costs.

"I find it rather comforting," Sarah replied, surprising herself with the admission. The steady hum reminded her of summer afternoons at her grandmother's house, where the neighborhood would come alive with the sounds of weekend yard work and children's laughter.

"You would," Diana said with a tight smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Some of us are trying to finish the quarterly reports."

Sarah turned back to her monitor, but her attention drifted to Mr. Chen. Through the window, she watched him pause to wipe his brow, his movements deliberate and dignified despite the sweltering heat. His weathered hands adjusted the weed wacker with the familiarity of old friends.

During lunch, Sarah found herself in the courtyard, sandwich in hand. Mr. Chen sat alone at a corner table, his simple meal spread before him.

"May I join you?" she asked.

He looked up, surprised, then nodded with a warm smile that transformed his entire face. "Please," he said, his accent thick but his hospitality genuine.

"I've been watching you work," Sarah began, then flushed at how stalker-like that sounded. "I mean, from my window. You take such care with the grounds."

Mr. Chen's eyes crinkled at the corners. "Every plant has purpose," he said, gesturing to the manicured landscape. "Like people. Some say weed is ugly, unwanted. But who decides? Maybe weed is flower in wrong place."

Sarah thought about Diana's earlier comments, about the hierarchy that existed even in their supposedly egalitarian workplace. About how some jobs were considered more valuable than others, some people more worthy of respect.

"The weed wacker," she said carefully. "It must be difficult to use such an old model."

"Ah," he patted the machine beside him like an old pet. "We understand each other, this machine and I. Sometimes old things have most to teach, if we listen."

As Sarah returned to her desk that afternoon, the sound of the weed wacker seemed different somehow. Its persistent hum carried notes of dedication, of quiet dignity, of wisdom that transcended the artificial boundaries of corporate culture.

Diana was still complaining, but Sarah barely heard her now. She was lost in thought about flowers and weeds, about the stories we tell ourselves about worth and beauty, about the wisdom that hums beneath the surface of things we too quickly dismiss as ugly or irrelevant.

The weed wacker's song continued outside her window, asking questions she wasn't sure how to answer.
