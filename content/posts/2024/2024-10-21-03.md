"These nuts are weak," Dr. Elena Chen muttered, examining the peculiar organic spheres under her microscope. After three months aboard the research station orbiting HD 40307g, this was the first sign of potential indigenous life they'd found.

"Weak how?" Sarah Matthews, her research partner, leaned forward with intense curiosity, her greying hair floating in the zero gravity.

"Their cellular structure... it's unlike anything we've seen. The membranes are incredibly thin, almost transparent. They shouldn't be able to maintain integrity under normal conditions."

Commander David Ross drifted into the lab module, his weathered face creased with concern. "Any breakthrough with those samples?"

"Yes and no," Elena replied, not looking up from her work. "They're definitely biological in nature, but they shouldn't exist. The physics doesn't add up."

"Elaborate," David commanded, his military background evident in his tone.

Sarah pulled up a holographic display. "Look at these readings. The molecular bonds are far too weak to survive even minimal gravitational forces. Yet we found them on the surface of a super-Earth with 1.3 times Earth's gravity."

"Could they be artificial?" David asked.

Elena finally looked up, her eyes wide with realization. "That's... actually brilliant, David. What if they're not meant to survive? What if they're meant to break down?"

"Like a message in a bottle that dissolves after reading?" Sarah mused.

The station's AI chimed in through the speakers. "Dr. Chen, I've completed the spectrographic analysis you requested. The nuts contain trace amounts of complex organic compounds arranged in a non-random pattern."

Elena's hands trembled as she manipulated the holographic data. "It's a code. These aren't nuts at all - they're storage devices. The weak cellular structure is deliberate; they're designed to break down in a specific sequence!"

"But who would leave such a message?" David wondered aloud. "We're the first expedition to this system."

Sarah's face suddenly paled. "Are we? Check the decay rate against the orbital period."

Elena's fingers flew across the haptic interface. The numbers aligned perfectly - the nuts would completely break down just as HD 40307g completed one orbit around its star.

"It's a timer," she whispered. "Someone - or something - knew we were coming. They calculated exactly when we'd arrive and left these for us to find."

The three humans floated in silence, watching as the "nuts" continued their inevitable decay, releasing their coded message one molecule at a time.

"Should we be concerned?" David finally asked.

Elena smiled mysteriously. "That depends on what you consider concerning, Commander. The message is repeating now. It's just three words..."

"Well?" Sarah and David asked in unison.

"'Welcome home, children.'"

The station continued its silent orbit around HD 40307g, while somewhere on its surface, more weak nuts waited to be discovered, each containing another piece of humanity's forgotten history.
