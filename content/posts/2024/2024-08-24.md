In the muted gray of an early Shanghai evening, where high-rises played sentinel to the ceaseless flow of human stories, Li Ming sat in her modest apartment, clutching the worn edges of a 人造的travel adapter. This unassuming device had been the only memento left by Wei Jun, her elusive ex-lover, who had vanished like smoke in the wind.

---

"Why doesn't he contact me?" Li Ming's voice trembled as she paced the small room. Her friend, Xiaohong, reclined on the faded couch, watching Li Ming with a mixture of sympathy and exasperation.

"Maybe he found himself a new muse overseas," Xiaohong replied, her tone edged with bitterness veiled by pragmatism. "Men like him, they never settle, you know."

Li Ming's eyes flickered with a mix of anger and sorrow. A tall, statuesque woman with eyes that could hold an ocean of unshed tears, she had a heart as cold and impassive as marble, sculpted over years of solitude and disappointment.

---

Days turned into weeks, and Li Ming found herself increasingly drawn to the travel adapter. A curiosity, a whispering doubt, nestled in her mind. With meticulous care, she dismantled it, hoping to find something more—an answer, perhaps. She found a tiny, hidden compartment containing a microSD card. Her heart raced as she inserted it into her laptop.

Encrypted folders. Files with cryptic names. It was a puzzle, a trace of Wei Jun’s enigmatic life.

---

Xiaohong, dressed in a chic cheongsam that accentuated her worldly elegance, leaned over Li Ming's shoulder. "This is a game, Li Ming. A test. He wants you to find him."

They delved together into the labyrinth of files, like Alice down the rabbit hole. Clues led them through digital landscapes—an old photograph of a Paris café, a scan of a newspaper article about a Berlin gallery, and finally, a file named "Eden".

Li Ming's fingers trembled as she opened the file. A video flickered to life—Wei Jun, seated in a dim room, his face haunted by shadows.

---

"Li Ming," Wei Jun's voice was a whisper, "If you are watching this, then you have found what I couldn't tell you in person. My life has taken a dark turn. Trust no one but Xiaohong, and find the garden in the city of lights."

Xiaohong's face drained of color. "We need to go to Paris."

Li Ming nodded, determination hardening her features. "The Garden of Eden."

---

Paris greeted them with its bittersweet charm, an old world wrapped in new enigmas. They found the garden—a hidden oasis in the heart of the city, where Wei Jun's dream and reality melded.

Beneath an old oak, they found him—not in person, but in a final letter, his elegant script bled on the yellowing paper.

---

"Li Ming, my heart's compass led you here because it was always your strength I relied on. My secrets were not mine alone to keep. In the Garden, may you find the peace I never could."

Li Ming’s tears fell like silent rain as the last light of day captured her grief-stricken face. The 人造的travel adapter lay between them, no longer just a device, but a symbol of their lost connection—electric, fleeting, and gone.

Xiaohong placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Let's go home, Li Ming. Some connections are meant to end so new ones can begin."

---

With the cold wind whispering around them, Li Ming knew she had to rebuild not just her life, but her heart—one connection at a time, with her memories as fleeting as the clicks of the travel adapter.
