"Remote access denied," the cold mechanical voice echoed through the cramped control room of Deep Space Station Beta. Dr. Sarah Chen slumped in her chair, exhausted after her twelfth attempt to reconnect with the quantum probe they'd sent to Alpha Centauri.

"Maybe we should call it a day, Sarah," suggested Dr. James Morrison, her longtime research partner. His weathered face reflected the blue glow of multiple displays surrounding them.

"No," Sarah shook her head firmly. "Something's not right. The QE-link was designed to be perfectly reliable. It's physically impossible for it to just... stop working."

The quantum-entangled communication system they'd developed was humanity's first truly instantaneous interstellar communication device. No light-speed delay, no signal degradation. It had worked flawlessly for the first six months of the mission.

Until today.

"Look at this," Sarah pointed to one of the screens. "The last transmission we received. These patterns... they're not random noise."

James leaned in closer, his eyes narrowing. "Some kind of embedded message?"

"Computer," Sarah called out, "run pattern analysis on the final transmission, focus on non-random sequences."

The AI responded immediately: "Analysis complete. Pattern detected. Converting to audio..."

A series of clicks and whistles filled the room, gradually resolving into something that made both scientists freeze in their tracks.

"That's impossible," James whispered.

The sounds were structured, rhythmic - unmistakably artificial. But they hadn't come from their probe.

"Someone - or something - hijacked our quantum link," Sarah said, her voice trembling with excitement and fear. "This is a response."

"From what? There's nothing out there but our probe!"

Sarah's fingers flew across the holographic keyboard. "Remember that old sci-fi story? About the civilization that lived inside neutron stars? What if..."

She was interrupted by another burst of sound from the speakers. This time, it was different - clearer, more deliberate. The computer began translating:

"WE SEE YOU WATCHING. STOP. DANGEROUS. THEY ARE COMING."

"They?" James's face had gone pale. "Who are 'they'?"

Before Sarah could respond, every screen in the control room suddenly blazed with the same message:

"TERMINATE QUANTUM LINK. NOW. FOR YOUR SAFETY."

"Sarah," James grabbed her arm, "maybe we should-"

"Wait!" She pulled away. "This could be the greatest discovery in human history! We can't just-"

The message changed:

"TOO LATE."

The quantum link indicator, which had been steadily pulsing red, suddenly turned green. Connected.

But what came through wasn't data from their probe.

The entire station's systems began to overload. Warnings blared as something vast and incomprehensible poured through their supposedly secure quantum channel.

"Emergency shutdown!" Sarah screamed, reaching for the master control.

The last thing they saw before everything went dark was a final message:

"WE TRIED TO WARN YOU. THEY USE QUANTUM LINKS LIKE DOORS. PREPARE."

In the darkness, Sarah and James heard something moving. Something that had come through their perfectly reliable remote connection.

Something that wasn't from Earth.

And somewhere, in the vast darkness between stars, their quantum probe continued its journey, now serving as a beacon for entities that had been waiting eons for someone to open a door.
