"Another immortal artifact has vanished?" Detective Li Mei furrowed her brow, examining the empty display case. The Celestial Archives, usually a sanctuary of mystical relics, had been breached.

Master Chen, the elderly curator, nodded gravely. "The Trustworthy Plate of Truth - a most reliable magical vessel. When activated, it reveals any lies spoken in its presence."

"Fascinating." Li Mei's eyes sparkled with interest. As both a mortal detective and a cultivation practitioner, such cases were her specialty. "Tell me about the security measures."

"Triple-layered spirit barriers, detection talismans, and..." Master Chen hesitated, "...our most skilled guardian disciples."

"Yet no signs of forced entry?" Li Mei circled the empty pedestal, her spiritual sense probing for traces.

"None whatsoever," a new voice interjected. A young man in flowing blue robes approached - Disciple Zhang, head of security. "The barriers weren't broken - they were disabled with the proper authorization codes."

Li Mei's eyes narrowed. "An inside job then. Who has access?"

"Only three people," Master Chen replied. "Myself, Disciple Zhang, and Elder Sun who's currently in closed-door meditation."

"I see." Li Mei pulled out a jade tablet, consulting her notes. "And where were you both last night?"

"I was performing the monthly blessing ritual in the East Hall," Master Chen said.

"Patrolling the outer courtyards," Zhang answered promptly.

Li Mei nodded, then suddenly smiled. "No need to question Elder Sun. I believe I've solved this case."

Master Chen looked startled. "So quickly?"

"Indeed. Disciple Zhang, would you be so kind as to empty your sleeve?"

The young man's face remained impassive. "I don't understand-"

"The plate responds to lies, does it not? Your spiritual energy contains traces of its resonance. You've been carrying it close to your body."

Zhang's composure cracked. "How did you-"

"Simple. You claimed to be patrolling outside, yet your robes carry the distinct incense residue from the Archive's inner chambers. Moreover, only someone intimately familiar with the security system could disable it so perfectly."

With a bitter laugh, Zhang withdrew the plate from his sleeve. "The Celestial Archives hoards such powerful artifacts, sharing them with none. I thought... with this plate, I could expose corruption in the cultivation world."

"Noble intentions," Li Mei said softly, "but theft remains theft."

Master Chen sighed. "Young Zhang, your heart is in the right place, but your methods are flawed. Perhaps instead of punishment, we could discuss establishing a proper system for artifact lending?"

Zhang's eyes widened with hope. "You would consider that?"

"Sometimes the best solution isn't catching a thief," Li Mei smiled, "but preventing the need for theft altogether."

In the end, the Trustworthy Plate was returned to its pedestal, but not before the Archives implemented new policies for sharing its treasures with qualified practitioners. And if anyone noticed Disciple Zhang taking particular care in cataloging artifact loan requests, well - that was simply part of his redemption.

Li Mei left satisfied, knowing she'd solved more than just a theft. Sometimes, the most reliable path to justice wasn't through punishment, but through understanding and change.
