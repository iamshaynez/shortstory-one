The afternoon sun cast long shadows across Grandmother Liu's courtyard as she methodically sorted through decades of accumulated possessions, stuffing them into large black trash bags. Her wrinkled hands lingered on each item - a faded photograph here, a child's toy there - while the spring breeze carried the sweet scent of blooming plum blossoms.

"Ma, you don't have to do this alone," called Mei-Lin from the doorway, her urban attire distinctly out of place in the rural setting. She watched her mother with concerned eyes.

"These things..." Grandmother Liu's voice wavered slightly. "Each one holds a story, child. Like this wooden horse - your father carved it the summer before you were born. The wood still carries the warmth of his hands, I think."

Mei-Lin stepped into the courtyard, her designer shoes crunching against the gravel. "Tell me about them, Ma. Tell me everything."

As they worked together, Grandmother Liu's memories flowed like the nearby stream - sometimes rushing, sometimes gentle. She described the texture of her wedding blanket, now threadbare but still soft, each patch a testament to years of careful mending. Her fingers traced the pattern of a chipped teacup, recalling how Grandfather would sip from it every morning, watching the sun rise over the fields.

"Your father used to say," she smiled, pulling out a rusty bicycle bell, "that memories are like the countryside after rain - everything becomes clearer, more vibrant."

"I remember that bell!" Mei-Lin exclaimed. "He would ring it twice when coming home from the fields."

As the afternoon wore on, more family members arrived - cousins, aunts, uncles - drawn by some invisible thread of memory. Soon, the courtyard buzzed with voices sharing stories, each discarded item sparking a new conversation.

"Remember when Uncle Wei crashed his bike into the duck pond?" laughed cousin Hong, holding up a muddy old wheel.

"And how about the time we all helped build the new roof?" added Uncle Chen, discovering a hammer among the things.

What began as a simple cleaning task transformed into an impromptu family reunion. Someone brought out chairs, another disappeared into the kitchen and returned with steaming bowls of noodles. The trash bags, temporarily forgotten, sat witness to the unfolding scene.

As evening approached, Grandmother Liu surveyed her courtyard - now cleaner, lighter, but still rich with history. The important things had been saved, not just in boxes or albums, but in the stories shared and memories renewed.

"Ma," Mei-Lin said softly, "why don't you come stay with me in the city? We could do this together, day by day."

Grandmother Liu looked at her daughter, then at the gathered family, their faces glowing in the sunset light. "Perhaps," she smiled, "it's time for some new memories."

The family stayed late into the night, planning future gatherings and promising more regular visits. As stars appeared above the old house, Grandmother Liu realized that what she thought would be an ending had become a beginning instead. The trash bags might have held old things, but they had helped unpack something far more valuable - the bonds that held them all together.
