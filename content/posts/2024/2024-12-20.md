The first time Sofía saw the spatula, it was nestled between dusty jars of exotic spices at Doña Alba’s kitchen stall in San Esperanza’s crumbling mercado. The scent of roasted cacao and wild guavas hung thick in the air, colliding with the chatter of merchants selling dreams they didn’t believe in. The spatula shimmered oddly, as though the light refused to rest on it properly, its handle carved from bone and its blade an iridescent metal that looked neither ancient nor new. Something about it whispered **危险**, its danger folding itself into the edges of time, yet Sofía couldn’t look away.

“I wouldn’t touch that, niña,” the elderly vendor rasped as Sofía reached for it. Doña Alba spoke with the measured cadence of one who’d lived past the rules of the natural world. “That spatula’s been in this market longer than memory. It makes promises it never intends to keep.”

Sofía hesitated. She had walked into the mercado with nothing but a wilted promise from her elusive lover, Diego, who once vowed under a mango tree to build her a future. They shared dreams like stolen kisses, fragile and quick, their love shaped by fireflies in the dark corners of an eternal summer. As the years passed, Diego stopped speaking of plans; his hands, strong as river stones, built nothing but distance. But here in Doña Alba’s stall, Sofía thought she saw the echo of Diego in the spatula’s eerie gleam—a relic of something broken but not gone.

“How much?” Sofía asked, her voice stubborn. She wasn’t sure why she wanted this strange thing, but in its unsettling shape, she thought she heard the story of their love: its beauty marred by something unintended, dangerous even.

Doña Alba narrowed her eyes. “It’s not for sale. But if you take it, well…” She trailed off, her words heavy like rain-soaked earth. “Don’t blame me when it starts taking you.”

Days turned to weeks, and Sofía found herself unable to resist using the spatula in her small café at the edge of the village. Its peculiar weight felt right in her hands, and with every dish she cooked—from mole to tamales wrapped in banana leaves—she felt her customers lean in, savoring flavors they could not name. Her café brimmed with life, the laughter of strangers mingling with the soulful guitar playing of a local street musician. It wasn’t long before Diego found himself drawn to her table again.

“Your cooking,” he murmured one night, his dark eyes locked on hers. “It tastes like forgiveness.”

Sofía froze, her heart tightening. Diego’s presence felt like the return of summer rain after the searing drought, both welcomed and resented. She should have hesitated, ached for the loneliness he had left her with—but instead, she cooked. He stayed, one day after another, until he was a shadow in every corner of her café. Days slid by in a dream that tasted bitter at its edges, like a mango rotting under too much sun.

One evening, with the dim light of a single lantern casting shadows on the mustard walls, the spatula began to hum in her hand. The noise was soft, barely perceptible, but it snaked into her mind and filled her head with whispers:

**He’ll leave you again.**

Her breath quickened. The spatula slipped from her hand, landing with a noise that seemed impossibly loud. Its iridescent blade shimmered even more vibrantly, almost mocking.

“Why are you staring at that old thing?” Diego’s tone was light, but his brow creased. His jacket hung loose around his shoulders, as though it wasn’t meant to stay.

“I… I don’t know.” Sofía turned to face him, clutching her apron to her chest. In the pit of her stomach, a storm began to brew.

“You never explain anything anymore,” she said suddenly, the words erupting like sap from an overripe fruit. “But I’m supposed to be fine with that, aren’t I?”

Diego’s silence was deafening. His hands, warm and calloused, reached for hers, but Sofía stepped back. Her fingers found the spatula on the counter, trembling as though it contained every untold story between them.

“What’s wrong?” Diego pressed, his voice suddenly unsure.

The whispers grew louder. **He belongs to someone else. You are only a pause in his life.**

And then, before Sofía could stop herself, the spatula moved. Perhaps it was her hands. Perhaps it wasn’t. The blade glinted, sharp and terrible, as Diego stepped forward. His eyes widened in shock, his body frozen.

Days later, the café sat in perfect silence, save for the squawk of a lone parrot perched on a crumbling wall. Doña Alba, stooped but steady, shuffled in. She ran a finger across the counter where the spatula lay, now dull and heavy as lead.

As she slid the spatula into her basket, she muttered, “I warned you, niña. Hearts are far more willing to break than to forgive.”

Then she was gone, leaving nothing but the faint scent of roasted cacao and wild guavas.
