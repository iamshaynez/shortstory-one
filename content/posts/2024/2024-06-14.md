"Another disappointing day," Viktor sighed, staring at the mountains of trash bags piling up outside his window. As the owner of the city's largest waste management company, he had grown numb to the endless cycle of garbage collection. His son Ivan's gaming addiction only added to his despair.

"Father, just one more round!" Ivan's voice echoed from his room, where he had been playing for the past twelve hours straight. The sounds of gunfire and explosions leaked through the walls.

"When will you understand? Life isn't a game you can restart!" Viktor's voice trembled with frustration. The widower had watched helplessly as his only son retreated further into virtual worlds, abandoning his responsibilities at the family business.

During dinner, the silence between them was deafening. Viktor observed his son's pale complexion, a stark contrast to the workers who toiled daily with the city's refuse. He remembered his own father's words about honest work and dignity - lessons that seemed lost on this generation.

"The workers are threatening to strike," Viktor finally spoke. "The new recycling regulations are impossible to meet with our current system."

Ivan paused his eating. "Why don't you gamify it?"

"What?"

"Turn the whole operation into a game. Like the ones I play - with points, achievements, teams competing against each other." Ivan's eyes lit up for the first time in months when discussing something other than his games.

Viktor scoffed initially, but as Ivan explained further, a spark of hope ignited. Together, they developed a system where workers formed teams, earning points for proper sorting, recycling targets, and customer satisfaction. The app Ivan designed made tracking progress intuitive and engaging.

Within months, the transformation was remarkable. Worker morale soared as teams competed for monthly bonuses. Recycling rates doubled. The streets became cleaner as citizens, inspired by the workers' enthusiasm, became more conscientious about waste disposal.

"You see, Father?" Ivan beamed during their inspection of the newly organized facility. "Games aren't just escape - they're tools for engagement, motivation, and change."

Viktor watched his son confidently directing workers, explaining features of the system he had created. The boy who once hid from reality had emerged as an innovative leader.

"Perhaps I was wrong," Viktor admitted, placing a proud hand on Ivan's shoulder. "Sometimes the solutions to our problems come from unexpected places."

That evening, father and son sat together, not in silence but in animated discussion about future improvements. Through the window, Viktor observed the orderly rows of sorted recyclables replacing the chaotic mountains of trash bags. In finding a way to bridge their generational gap, they had also found a way to serve their community better.

"You know," Ivan smiled, "there's this multiplayer strategy game I think you might enjoy..."

Viktor laughed, surprising himself with his response: "Why not? It's never too late to learn new things."
