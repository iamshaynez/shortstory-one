"Another set, Mr. Harrison?" the mechanical voice chirped as James wiped the sweat from his brow. The sleek chrome dumbbells floated effortlessly beside him, their anti-gravity mechanisms humming softly in the dim light of his cramped apartment.

"No thanks, FLEX," he muttered to his AI training assistant. "I can barely afford the energy credits for today's workout as it is."

The year was 2157, and like most citizens of New London, James spent his days lifting "smart weights" - government-mandated exercise equipment that harvested human kinetic energy to power the sprawling megacity. The wealthy elite lived in the gleaming upper levels, while workers like James toiled in the depths, quite literally powering their luxurious lifestyles one rep at a time.

"Your performance metrics are declining, Mr. Harrison," FLEX noted with artificial concern. "The Authority requires a minimum of 2,000 energy credits per week. You are currently at 1,742."

James gritted his teeth. "Well maybe if they didn't keep raising the quotas while cutting our food rations-"

A sharp knock at the door cut him off. "Energy Collection Unit, open up!"

His heart sank as two enforcement officers barged in, their chrome badges gleaming. "James Harrison, you've fallen behind on your energy contributions," the taller one stated flatly. "The Authority has deemed you an inefficient resource."

"Please," James pleaded, "I've been working double shifts. My daughter's been sick-"

"Your excuses are irrelevant," the second officer interrupted. "You'll be relocated to an Enhanced Production Facility for optimization."

As they moved to seize him, James grabbed one of the floating dumbbells and swung it desperately. The anti-grav field flickered and failed, sending the heavy weight crashing through the cheap plasteel floor. Alarms blared as the officers drew their weapons.

"Stop! You'll destabilize the entire level!" one shouted.

But James kept swinging, the "smart" weights becoming dumb hunks of metal in his hands. Floor after floor crumbled as he fought, the carefully maintained hierarchy of New London literally collapsing.

Through the growing chaos, he caught glimpses of other apartments - other lives ground down by the machine of progress. A child's abandoned holo-toy. A family's meager dinner left cooling. A wall of achievement certificates earned through endless hours of mandatory exercise.

As structural supports groaned and emergency sirens wailed, James thought he caught a glimpse of the upper levels through the broken ceiling - their pristine towers now tilting precariously as their foundation of exploited labor crumbled away.

"Sometimes," he whispered to himself as the officers closed in, "the only way to fix a broken system is to let it fall."

The dumbbells lay scattered around him, no longer floating, no longer "smart" - just cold pieces of metal that had finally served their true purpose: revealing the weight of inequality that had become too heavy to bear.

In the distance, through the growing gaps in the city's carefully maintained walls, James saw the first rays of real sunlight he'd witnessed in years. And he smiled.
