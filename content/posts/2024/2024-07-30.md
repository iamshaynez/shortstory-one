"My dear," Mrs. Hastings adjusted her lace collar with practiced precision, "have you heard about the peculiar circumstances surrounding young Miss Eleanor's sudden... departure from society?"

Lady Worthington raised a perfectly arched eyebrow, her teacup hovering midway to her lips. "Do tell, though I warn you, I find gossip most unseemly."

"It is not mere gossip, I assure you. The poor girl was found in her garden, terribly burned despite the cloudy day. The most curious detail being the unused bottle of sunblock clutched in her lifeless hand."

Eleanor's spirit, hovering unseen above the chattering ladies, rolled her ethereal eyes. How typical of the ton to reduce her tragic tale to drawing room fodder. If only they knew she was now condemned to serve as a guardian spirit, protecting others from her own fatal mistake.

"Your next charge approaches," announced her supervisor, a stern-faced specter named Madame Prudence. "Remember, you must prevent them from repeating your... indiscretion."

Below, a young woman remarkably similar to Eleanor's former self lounged by a pool, repeatedly checking her social media instead of applying sunscreen. The sight stirred uncomfortable memories.

"Miss Catherine," Eleanor whispered, allowing just enough of her presence to create a gentle breeze. "Perhaps you might consider the sunblock?"

"In a minute," Catherine mumbled, scrolling endlessly.

"That's precisely what I said," Eleanor sighed. "And look where it got me."

Several failed attempts later, Eleanor resorted to more dramatic measures. She materialized partially - just enough to appear as a shimmer in the air - causing Catherine to shriek and drop her phone.

"Lord have mercy!" Catherine clutched her chest. "Are you... are you real?"

"As real as the UV rays currently damaging your skin," Eleanor replied dryly. "I was once like you, my dear. Too absorbed in trivial matters to take proper care of myself. Now I'm doomed to prevent others from sharing my fate."

Catherine's eyes widened. "But surely a few minutes..."

"That's what we all say, isn't it? Such indolence is the true curse of our society - this perpetual postponement of what truly matters in favor of idle pleasures."

To Eleanor's surprise, Catherine reached for the sunblock, applying it with trembling hands. "Will you... will you go away now?"

"For the moment. Though I'll return if you need another reminder. That's my punishment - or perhaps my redemption."

As Eleanor faded away, she heard Catherine muttering about deleting her social media accounts. Perhaps there was hope for this generation after all.

Madame Prudence appeared, looking unusually pleased. "Well done. You've finally learned the lesson yourself - that true grace lies not in idle pursuits but in caring for others. You're ready to move on."

"Move on?"

"Your service is complete. You've earned your reincarnation. Though do try to be more diligent about sun protection in your next life."

Eleanor felt a warmth unlike any she'd known in death. As she dissolved into light, she wondered if her next self would remember this lesson. She rather hoped so - eternally haunting the careless was exhausting work indeed.
