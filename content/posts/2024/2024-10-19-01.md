The sunglasses lay stiff and motionless on Marcus's nightstand, their metallic frames dulled by years of neglect. They were more than just an accessory; they were a portal to his past life – a life he desperately tried to reclaim through his inexplicable second chance.

"You can't keep wearing those," Sarah said, her voice carrying the weight of concerned observation. "They belong to a different time."

Marcus traced the frame's edge with trembling fingers. "These were the last thing I saw before the accident. Before everything changed."

The room fell silent, heavy with unspoken understanding. Sarah watched as her brother struggled with the paradox of his existence – a man reborn into his own timeline, cursed with the knowledge of his previous demise.

"The world isn't meant to accommodate second chances like this," Marcus muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. "Every morning, I wake up expecting to be back there, in that moment."

The sunglasses had become his anchor, a physical manifestation of the temporal divide between his two lives. Like Melville's white whale, they represented an obsession that threatened to consume him entirely.

"Perhaps that's why you were given this chance," Sarah suggested, settling beside him. "Not to relive the past, but to chart a different course."

Marcus lifted the sunglasses, watching as afternoon light played across their scratched lenses. "You don't understand. These aren't just sunglasses. They're proof that it all happened. That I'm not going mad."

"And what about the life you're living now? Isn't it real enough?"

The question hung in the air like morning mist, refusing to dissipate. Marcus had spent months trying to reconcile his memories of death with his newfound existence. Each day felt like walking a tightrope between two realities.

"I see them sometimes," he confessed, "the people from before. They look at me like they know – like they can sense I don't belong here."

Sarah reached for his hand, her touch grounding him in the present. "You belong wherever you choose to exist, Marcus. The past is just a story we tell ourselves."

But Marcus knew better. The sunglasses weren't just an object; they were a reminder of the cosmic debt he owed. Every moment of his second life felt borrowed, as if the universe might suddenly realize its mistake and reclaim what it had given.

"I can't let go," he whispered, clutching the sunglasses tighter. "They're all I have left of who I was."

"Then who are you now?"

The question struck him like a physical blow. In his obsession with preserving his past self, he had forgotten to become anyone new.

As twilight painted the room in shades of amber, Marcus stood and approached the window. With mechanical precision, he unfolded the sunglasses one last time. They felt foreign in his hands now, like artifacts from a stranger's life.

"Goodbye," he breathed, and let them fall.

But as the sunglasses shattered on the pavement below, Marcus felt no liberation. Instead, a profound emptiness settled in his chest – the realization that in destroying his link to the past, he had also severed his understanding of his place in the present.

The world continued turning, indifferent to his small act of defiance against fate. And Marcus stood at the window, a man twice-lived but never truly alive, watching as the sun set on both his lives.
