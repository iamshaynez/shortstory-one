"Your flashlight tastes... salty," Max said, running his augmented tongue over the metallic surface.

Lei rolled her eyes, snatching back the device. "That's because it's powered by tears," she replied matter-of-factly, as if this was the most normal thing in the world. In Neo Shanghai 2157, maybe it was.

The neon-soaked streets reflected in the puddles beneath their feet, creating mirror worlds that seemed more real than reality itself. Lei's blue hair sparked and crackled with embedded fiber optics – a fashion statement that doubled as a mood indicator. Right now, they were pulsing with anxiety.

"You're still collecting them?" Max asked, his cybernetic eye whirring as it adjusted to the darkness of the alley. "Thought the Corps banned emotional harvesting last year."

"They banned a lot of things," Lei muttered, her voice barely audible over the constant hum of the city. "Doesn't mean they were right."

The flashlight flickered, casting strange shadows on the graffiti-covered walls. Each beam of light carried the essence of someone's sorrow, transformed into pure energy through the black market converter Lei had acquired from the underground markets.

"It's not just about power," she continued, noting Max's skeptical expression. "Each tear tells a story. The salt... it's like a signature of someone's pain. When you use it, you're carrying their burden, sharing it. Making it mean something."

Max leaned against the wall, his synthetic arm gleaming. "That's awfully poetic for someone who deals in illegal tech."

"Maybe that's why they banned it," Lei smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "Too much poetry in a world of profit margins."

The conversation was interrupted by the wail of Corp security drones. Lei's hair flashed red with warning. "We need to move," she said, already calculating escape routes through her neural interface.

"Wait," Max grabbed her arm. "What exactly are you planning with all this collected grief?"

Lei held up the flashlight, its beam cutting through the neon haze. "I'm building something. A network of shared emotions. When enough tears are connected, they create patterns. Patterns become messages. Messages become..."

"Become what?"

"Hope," she whispered. "Real hope. Not the synthetic kind they sell in vials."

As if in response, the flashlight suddenly blazed brighter than ever, illuminating the entire alley in a warm, almost natural light. The salt crystals in its core had aligned perfectly, creating a cascade effect that neither of them had anticipated.

In that moment, both their neural feeds lit up with thousands of connections – other collectors, other gatherers of tears, all linked through the shared wavelength of human emotion. What the Corps had tried to suppress had instead become a underground network of genuine feeling, of shared experience.

Lei's hair shimmered with all colors of the spectrum. "See?" she laughed, real joy breaking through her careful facade. "Sometimes the saltiest tears lead to the sweetest victories."

Max stared at the phenomenon unfolding before them, his cybernetic systems struggling to process the pure humanity of it all. "You know," he said finally, "I think I'm starting to understand why they were so afraid of this."

The light continued to pulse, each beat a testament to the enduring spirit of youth, even in a world that tried to commodify every aspect of human existence. In the end, it wasn't the technology that changed things – it was the simple, salty truth of human tears.
