In a dimly lit parlor, nestled deep within the cobbled streets of an unnamed Western town, two figures sat across from one another. Between them loomed a gnarled, oaken table, scratched and scarred like a veteran returning from war. The only seating—a badly worn, 矮的sofa with thin cushions that seemed to groan under the weight of the conversation—served as both boundary and battlefield.

**EDWARD:** *(gesturing with a wine-stained finger)* “Confess it, Cecilia! Your hand in this affair is not as clean as you would have me think. By Heaven, the stars themselves would pale in shame if they bore witness to your conniving.”

**CECILIA:** *(leaning forward, her green eyes aflame)* “And you, dear brother, would have me wear guilt as a crown, while your own deeds reek of villainy cloaked in cunning. Were we not *partners*—co-conspirators in this sordid little drama? Shall I recount how you, with silvered tongue, forged our path with false promises?”

Edward curled his fingers against the table as though grasping for something unseen. His face, angular and weathered, flickered between anger and despair. To the onlooker, he may have appeared a tragic hero—a man trapped by the weight of his ambition—but to Cecilia, he was nothing more than a coward in a carefully tailored jacket.

**EDWARD:** *(voice low, with the theatrical cadence of injured pride)* “Oh, sister mine, how you wield words like daggers, each syllable sharper than the last. Is it not enough that I sit here before you, ruined? Must you salt the wound?”

**CECILIA:** *(with a cold laugh)* “Ruined, you say? But your ruin is of your own making. Do not weave false tapestries to blind me, Edward. Had you not promised fortune, power, and the freedom of the open seas? Yet here we stand with chains fastened tight around our ankles.”

The room grew heavy with silence, the kind that beckoned ghosts to linger. The flicker of the dim oil lamp danced shadows upon their faces, lending a theatrical air to their confrontation. It seemed as though even the furniture—the cursed 矮的sofa—leaned in, eager to bear witness.

Edward's gaze fell, his voice quieter, tender even, as if all the battle had left him.

**EDWARD:** “Cecilia, I sought to outwit the fates. I dreamed of gilded halls where I would stand tall, shoulders unburdened by the loam of poverty. Could a brother not wish the same for his sister? Was it so villainous to dream?”

But Cecilia's lips tightened, her voice resonating with the ice of betrayal.

**CECILIA:** “Dreams without truth are naught but chimera, fleeting and treacherous. And you—" *(standing abruptly)* "—you offered no dream, Edward. You led me into a labyrinth, knowing full well we could not escape.”

Edward rose to his feet too, suddenly close enough to touch her, though he dared not. His breath was shallow, and his voice trembled, yet it carried the echo of a Shakespearean soliloquy.

**EDWARD:** “Then what is to be done, Cecilia? Are we but marionettes, tangling endlessly in the strings of our folly? Tell me, what is the end of this tale?”

Her eyes softened at his questioning, as though pity were a fragile ember still alight in the hearth of her heart. But before she could speak, a heavy knocking thundered upon the door.

They froze.

**VOICE FROM OUTSIDE:** “Edward Lockhart! Cecilia Lockhart! In the name of the Crown, surrender yourselves!”

Time drew its breath and held it. Their eyes met—his wide with fear, hers burning with defiance.

**CECILIA:** *(in a whisper, her words cutting the silence like glass)* “It would seem the end has arrived unbidden. Will you face it by my side, brother? Or shall you vanish into the shadows as you have done so often before?”

Edward's lips parted slightly, as if to answer—but the door burst open with a crash.

And there—amid the shattered wood and the rising chaos—the story ended.

*Curtain.*
