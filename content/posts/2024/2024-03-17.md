"I have the perfect first aid kit," Lucy declared, pulling out a small tin box decorated with faded flowers. We sat cross-legged on her bedroom floor, afternoon light casting geometric shadows through the windowpane.

"Perfect for what?" I asked, eyeing the unremarkable container.

"For fixing anything. Everything." She clicked open the latch with practiced fingers. "Watch."

Inside wasn't the expected assembly of bandages and antiseptic. Instead, I saw a collection of seemingly random objects: a smooth gray pebble, a pressed flower, an old movie ticket stub, a blue ribbon, a small silver bell.

"That's not a first aid kit," I pointed out. "That's just... stuff."

Lucy's eyes sparkled with that familiar intensity I'd known since we were children. "Every item heals something specific. The pebble absorbs worry. The flower repairs broken promises. The ticket stub helps you find your way when you're lost. The ribbon ties up loose ends. And the bell..." She picked up the tiny silver bell, holding it reverently. "The bell calls back things you've lost."

I wanted to roll my eyes, to dismiss it as another of Lucy's whimsical fantasies. But there was something in her voice that made me hesitate.

"Show me," I said finally.

She handed me the pebble first. It was warm to the touch, despite the cool air. "Hold it and think about what's worrying you."

I closed my fingers around it, thinking of college applications, uncertain futures, the growing distance between us as senior year drew to a close. The stone seemed to pulse gently.

"Now look," she whispered.

When I opened my hand, tiny hairline cracks had appeared in the pebble's smooth surface.

"Your worries are being absorbed," Lucy explained. "They'll heal over time, leaving new patterns. Like kintsugi."

That afternoon, we tested each item in her peculiar first aid kit. The pressed flower made us spontaneously apologize for old hurts we'd never discussed. The movie ticket showed us glimpses of paths we might take. The ribbon helped us find words for feelings we couldn't express.

Finally, Lucy lifted the silver bell.

"What have you lost?" she asked softly.

"Us," I replied without thinking. "We're not the same anymore."

She rang the bell once. The sound was both present and absent, like remembering a dream. In that moment, I saw us as we were at seven, twelve, fifteen - all our past selves overlapping like double-exposed photographs.

When the sound faded, Lucy was packing away her perfect first aid kit. "Sometimes," she said, "healing means accepting that things change."

I reached for the tin box. "Can I borrow it?"

She shook her head, smiling sadly. "It only works when we're together."

Years later, I found a similar tin box in a dusty antique shop. Inside were ordinary bandages and antiseptic cream. But sometimes, when the light hits it just right, I swear I can hear the faint echo of a silver bell, calling back memories of an afternoon when everything and nothing was fixed by a perfect first aid kit that never existed at all.

Or did it?
