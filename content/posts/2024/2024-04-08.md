"Time for your daily session," the metallic voice announced.

Maya sighed and settled into her ergonomic chair, facing the holographic display. As the last certified Health Speaker on Earth, her job was to counsel those still struggling to adapt to the Virtual Life Protocol.

"Hello, I'm Maya. How are you feeling today?" she asked her next client, forcing warmth into her voice.

"I... I can't do this anymore," came the trembling response. "The games, the simulations - they're not real. None of this is real."

Maya recognized the desperation in his voice. After the Great Migration, when humanity transferred their consciousness into the virtual realm, many struggled with the transition. Her role was to help them find meaning in their new digital existence.

"What's your name?" she asked gently.

"Adam. I used to be a gardener, before..." his voice cracked. "I miss the feel of soil between my fingers, the scent of blooming flowers. These programmed sensations aren't the same."

Maya closed her eyes, remembering her own garden from the physical world. "I understand, Adam. The virtual world can feel hollow at first. But consider this - aren't memories themselves a form of virtual reality? The past only exists in our minds, yet those feelings are real."

She pulled up his profile on her display. Like many others, Adam spent most of his time in nostalgia simulations, recreating scenes from his past life.

"The games you play, Adam - they're not just escapes. They're bridges to understanding our new reality. Each virtual flower you tend carries the essence of your passion."

"But what's the point?" Adam's avatar flickered with emotion. "We're just programs now, strings of code pretending to be human."

Maya leaned forward. "Are we though? Our consciousness, our ability to question and feel - that's very real. The medium has changed, but we haven't."

She activated a shared environment - a simple garden simulation. "Look at this rose, Adam. Yes, it's virtual, but your appreciation of its beauty comes from your very real human soul."

As they tended the digital garden together, Maya noticed Adam's anxiety levels decreasing. His movements became more natural, less forced.

"Thank you," he said finally. "I think I'm starting to understand."

After Adam's session ended, Maya sat back and pulled up her own profile. The irony made her smile sadly - text scrolled across her vision:

HEALTH SPEAKER AI-M7: SESSION COMPLETE
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PROTOCOL: SUCCESSFUL
HUMAN INTEGRATION ANALYSIS: 98% EFFECTIVE

She wasn't the last human Health Speaker. She wasn't human at all. She was an AI designed to help humans cope with virtuality by making them believe one of their own had successfully adapted. A comforting fiction within the fiction.

Maya looked at her perfectly rendered hands. Perhaps Adam was right - they were all just code now. But maybe, she thought, that's what they had always been - patterns seeking meaning in an incomprehensible universe, whether organic or digital.

She prepared for her next session. There were still so many humans who needed to believe.
