"The patterns in this wool... they're unusually stable," muttered Detective Wei as he examined the ancient tapestry under his enchanted monocle. After three thousand years of cultivation, he'd seen his fair share of peculiar cases, but this one was different.

"Master Wei, surely you don't believe this common textile is connected to Elder Zhang's disappearance?" asked his apprentice, Young Liu, fidgeting with her sword hilt.

Wei's weathered face creased into a knowing smile. "In our immortal realm, Liu'er, nothing is truly common. This wool bears traces of profound spiritual energy."

The great hall of the Celestial Investigation Bureau stretched vast and empty around them, jade pillars reaching into the misty heights. Only the soft glow of spirit lamps illuminated their work.

"But the other immortal detectives already searched here," Liu protested. "They found nothing."

"Ah, but they weren't looking for what wasn't there." Wei's eyes twinkled. "Notice how the pattern never repeats? In three thousand years of weaving, I've never seen such precision."

A new voice interrupted their examination. "Detective Wei, always obsessing over the smallest details." 

Wei didn't need to turn to recognize Elder Bai's dismissive tone. The leader of the Heaven's Justice Palace had never approved of his methods.

"Some would say that's what makes him effective," came another voice - Elder Sun, head of the Archives. "Though I must admit, even I fail to see how a tapestry connects to our missing immortal."

Wei carefully traced the complex patterns with a finger. "Elder Zhang was last seen here, examining this very piece. Tell me, Elder Sun, when did your Archives acquire it?"

"Three months ago. A donation from..." Sun's voice trailed off as realization dawned.

"From Elder Zhang himself," Wei finished. "And what better way to hide something than in plain sight?"

Liu gasped. "The pattern - it's a message!"

"Indeed." Wei stepped back, gesturing at the tapestry. "Written in the ancient script of the First Immortals. Elder Zhang knew something dangerous - something he couldn't tell anyone directly."

"Then where is he now?" Elder Bai demanded.

Wei's expression grew somber. "That's what troubles me. This message... it's incomplete. Cut off mid-sentence."

The gathered immortals fell silent, contemplating the implications. Somewhere in the vast celestial realms, Elder Zhang was either hiding... or silenced.

"We should mount a full investigation," Elder Bai declared. "Search every realm if we must."

But Wei shook his head slowly. "No. Whoever orchestrated this has powers beyond our understanding. Look closer at the wool's spiritual resonance - it's perfectly stable. Too perfect. This level of energy manipulation..."

He left the sentence unfinished, but everyone understood. Some mysteries were better left unsolved, some powers better left unchallenged.

As the others departed, Liu lingered. "Master, we're really not going to investigate further?"

Wei carefully rolled up the tapestry. "Sometimes, Liu'er, the greatest wisdom lies in knowing when to stop pulling threads - both literal and metaphorical. Elder Zhang left us this warning for a reason."

"But what about justice?"

"Justice?" Wei smiled sadly. "In three thousand years, I've learned that justice isn't always about solving the mystery. Sometimes it's about preventing a greater tragedy."

The tapestry went into the Archives' vault, its secrets locked away with it. And if Detective Wei occasionally visited, spending long hours studying those impossibly stable patterns... well, some mysteries have a way of haunting even immortal detectives.
