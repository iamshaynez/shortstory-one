"I must know what lurks in that mind of yours, Zhang Wei," Detective Liu quipped, eyeing his companion with faux suspicion as they shuffled out of the dimly-lit, smoke-filled Mahjong parlor. The flickering neon sign buzzed overhead like a migraine. 

Zhang Wei, a man whose entire demeanor radiated an enigmatic aura, chuckled. His life was a tapestry of curious habits and unplaceable interests, the kind that sparked intrigue and rumors. "It's nothing but healthy switches up here, my friend," he said, tapping his temple playfully. "The mind is a circuit. Each thought, a potential energy, just waiting to be redirected."

The savory aroma of street food mingled with the night air, giving Liu a moment's pleasure before he nudged the conversation back to its usual banter. "Speaking of switching, I've had a theory brewing—a query that involves none other than your peculiar tendencies." 

Zhang gave a theatrical sigh. "Here we go again," he mumbled, though amusement tugged at the corners of his mouth. Despite his partner's penchant for concocting outlandish theories, he had a soft spot for this particular exercise in camaraderie.

Liu, unfazed, continued with the zeal of a prosecutor. "I've deduced that your late-night walks aren't just for exercise. You're unearthing secrets, aren't you? Perhaps the descent into the cybercafé at Shui Fang District is more than just an insatiable quest for caffeine?"

The night felt alive, the city’s heartbeat drumming ever so softly beneath their feet as they strolled through the alley. Zhang stopped suddenly, provoking a small collision. "You couldn't be more wrong if you tried," he smirked, adopting a mock-serious tone. "I'm weaving a layer of anonymity around myself. Every visit to an obscure location adds a thread, making me indefinable, you see? Like a character in one of those pretentious novels."

Liu laughed, genuinely, the kind of laughter that dawns in echoes between friends. "Ah, the philosophy of the unknowable—so surreal—perfectly fitting the pang of urban existential dilemmas."

Their laughter aside, Liu's instincts rarely faltered. The entangled mystery of Zhang Wei's midnight endeavours gnawed at his curiosity. Yet, respect surmounted his eagerness; their bond was edged with peculiar humor rarely understood beyond their fold.

As dawn began to drape the city in muted grays, Zhang extended an uninvited revelation. "It’s ironic, you know," he mused, his voice trailing into a quieter octave. "Seeking mystery in the ordinary becomes its own paradox," he concluded, leaving the sentence a dangling question.

Running his fingers over his bald head, Liu echoed the sentiment. "And what of the result?” he replied. "This pursuit of a thin, illusive veil—how often does it lift?"

Zhang didn’t respond immediately, allowing the thud of distant footsteps to underscore his silence. Finally, an answer came, weighted and deliberate, "More often than not, Liu, it’s not of the veil we should be wary, but of the mirror it reveals. The reflection is the true riddle."

The bitterness of what lay unsaid lingered. This exchange on the cusp of humor and sincerity unveiled nothing yet everything; an unsolvable riddle wrapped in their camaraderie—a perfectly healthy yet bitter switch. And like a dance that never needed music, they moved on, leaving the past night and its secrets seething in the city's waking bustle.
