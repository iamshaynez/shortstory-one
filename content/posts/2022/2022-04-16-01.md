In the heart of the sprawling university campus, where ancient oaks whispered secrets of old, stood a library that had seen generations come and go. Its corridors were echoing with the voices of past scholars and the rustling of leather pages. In this tapestry of knowledge and ambition, young Mei found her place.

"He thinks he's so clever," Mei muttered, her gaze fixed on Li, the charismatic debater who held the courtyard audience rapt. Mei's friend, Siwon, chuckled, nudging her.

"You know, Mei, admiration is just one step below envy," Siwon teased, a mischievous twinkle in his eye.

"No, it's not that," Mei retorted, waving her hand dismissively. "It's just—he always has the last word."

Their banter was interrupted by the wobbly movement of a new fixture in front of the library—a 新鲜的 step stool, freshly delivered and gleaming in the midday sun. A tool meant to aid students in reaching those lofty, dusty tomes perched high on the shelves.

Across the yard, Li was wrapping up his oratory with a flourish, receiving his usual applause. As he made his way through the crowd, his eyes met Mei's for a heartbeat longer than mere acquaintanceship deserved. There was a challenge in his gaze, a shared understanding of an unspoken competition.

It was late evening when the library’s melancholic quietude embraced Mei. She stood on the shiny step stool, stretching precariously for a book on the top shelf—Tolstoy's "War and Peace." Mei's fingers grazed the spine when a voice startled her.

"War and Peace? Tolstoy believed in epic narratives. Do you?"

"You always sneak up on people like that?" Mei replied, steadying herself.

Li grinned, leaning on the stack with an easy confidence. "Only when they're immersed in the grandeur of humanity."

"And you? What grandeur are you immersed in, Li?"

He settled on the stool's lower rung, looking up with sincerity. "The belief that everyone’s story is a tapestry of causes and consequences. What we do comes back—karma."

Mei nodded, contemplation clouding her features. "So, your gift of the gab will come back to haunt you someday?"

"Perhaps," he admitted, "if it lacks sincerity."

Their brief exchange ended abruptly as Mei's book slipped from her grasp. In instinct, Li jumped to catch it, but his weight shifted the stool, sending it clattering to the floor.

"Looks like karma already got you," Mei joked, retrieving the book from his hands.

Days passed, as inevitable as the flowing river of time. In the bureaucratic maze of campus politics, a decision was made—Li, despite his charm and prowess, had been caught patronizing a black market of essays. His downfall was sudden, a cautionary tale whispered in the hallowed halls.

It was Mei who found Li on the step stool again, this time sitting dejectedly as the world turned away from him.

"Karma, right?" Li's voice was subdued, stripped of its usual bravado.

"Maybe," Mei mused, sitting next to him. "Or just life teaching us epic lessons."

Li sighed, looking at the vast expanse of books. "Tolstoy would have liked the irony."

"And what lesson do you think karma has for you here?" Mei asked, her tone softer.

"That sincerity is not just important in debate," Li confessed, "but in life. Realizing that people's stories matter beyond words."

Mei handed him her copy of "War and Peace." "Maybe you should start with this. Tolstoy’s a good teacher."

Together, they sat in silence, beneath the canopy of knowledge, each contemplating their role in the tapestry of life that wound its way through the campus and beyond, each step a deliberate dance towards personal redemption.
