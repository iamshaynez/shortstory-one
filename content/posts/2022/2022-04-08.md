The campus buzzed with the late afternoon chatter of students, eager to retreat from their academic routines. Among them, Alex stood by the aged and weather-beaten bench under the sycamore tree. His eyes were fixed on a solitary object nestled in his backpack—his "sad microphone," a gift from his father who had once been a singer. It was a constant reminder of passion unvoiced, dreams unpursued.

"Got plans, Alex?" Mark asked, his backpack slung casually over one shoulder, full of animated energy. Alex shook his head, his hand reflexively brushing the microphone through the canvas of his bag.

"Another day of aimless wandering, I guess," Alex replied, his voice barely audible over the rustling leaves. Still, the words carried weight, like pebbles thrown into a tranquil pond, rippling with hidden depth.

Mark eyed him curiously. "Still holding onto that thing, huh? Why not do something about it?"

"Why don’t you join the band? We could use a voice like yours," his eyes were earnest, searching for a spark in Alex's usual stoicism. 

"I told you, I'm not much of a singer," Alex dismissed, but his fingers drummed against his knee as if yearning to play a rhythm only he could hear.

Sandra, the ever-cheerful organizer of campus events, joined them with an air of purpose. "Hey, Alex, you've got to come to the talent show next week! We need new voices, and you’d be perfect!" Her enthusiasm was infectious, yet Alex only managed a half-hearted smile.

"I’m not sure, Sandy. Maybe another time." He avoided her gaze, focusing instead on a discarded leaflet skittering across the pathway. 

His reluctance was met with a gentle relentlessness. "Think about it," Sandra persisted, her words lingering in the air long after she had rushed off, trailing promises and potential behind her.

Days passed, and the talent show loomed ever closer. Alex found himself returning to the sycamore tree, the mic a persistent reminder. It seemed heavier, imbued with more than mechanical parts—filled instead with the weight of what could have been and what might still be.

"Hey," Mark prompted one afternoon, as they lounged languidly between classes, surrounded by the familiar cacophony of campus life. "What are you so afraid of?"

Alex hesitated, vulnerable for a moment. "It's just... what if I'm no good? What if it's not like how it was for my dad?"

Mark paused before responding, choosing his words like one would select a delicate instrument. "You won't know until you try. And besides, even if it's not, maybe it’s something different. Maybe it’s yours."

The day of the show arrived unexpectedly, with its usual blend of chaos and excitement. Alex found himself backstage, his heart echoing the anxious rhythm always reserved for pivotal moments. 

One by one, performers took their turn, voices mingling in harmonious symphony, each leaving their mark on the stage’s wooden planks. Alex clutched the microphone as his moment drew near, a sudden gravity anchoring his resolve.

As he stepped forward, lights caught the sheen of anticipation in eyes both familiar and not. He raised the microphone, a dozen emotions tumbling through him like the notes of an unfinished melody.

Yet, silence greeted his performance—a silence deep and profound, broken only by the soft rustle of the audience shifting as they leaned in, expectant. Alex stood frozen, a chilling revelation sweeping over him: he had never turned the microphone on.

The silence, however, spoke louder than words. It weighed in the air, a moment stretched into eternity. The unexpected poignancy of his silent echo—his unspoken courage—stirred something deep within, casting ripples across the audience, who erupted in applause, deafening and full of understanding.

In the end, Alex's "sad microphone" had indeed told a story, one he never anticipated but desperately needed—it was his voice that mattered, microphone or not.
