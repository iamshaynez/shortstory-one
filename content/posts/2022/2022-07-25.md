In a quaint, serpentine village nestled between the folds of forgotten time and uncharted maps, Teller was known for his remarkable knack for creating exquisite artifacts that shimmered like stars. Yet today, in his labyrinthine workshop, he faced an unusual conundrum.

"I need a resolution, Neven," admitted Teller, his fingers tracing the swirling patterns of a strange porcelain jar. The air quivered with the scent of fresh parchment and obscure spices, mixing into a familiar ambiance. 

Neven, a petite figure with eyeglasses perched precariously on her nose, leaned closer. Her curiosity was as boundless as it was infectious. "What troubles you, Teller? You've crafted universes in a teacup before."

Teller sighed, gesturing to the jar. "It’s this yogurt." He paused dramatically, enjoying the expectant silence that Neven detested parts of her reluctantly adored. "It's absurdly... diligent."

"Diligent yogurt?" Neven echoed, her eyebrows a high arc of skepticism. "Now that's a novelty. What does it do? Run errands? Solve mazes for breakfast?"

"It transforms," Teller replied, his voice a slow rumble like thunder in a dream. "Every time I attempt to savor it, it shapes answers within itself—answers of truth and riddles, woven into new enigmas."

Neven adjusted her glasses, the world glinting off her skeptical lenses. “Show me,” she dared.

Teller obliged, opening the jar with the reverence one reserves for ancient tomes. A gentle mist curled out, whispering secrets caught in half-breaths. In the cool depths, they saw patterns—words? Maps? Neither? "This maze," Teller mused, "echoes of the one Borges once scribbled."

Neven’s eyes flashed with the thrill of discovery. "A labyrinth that speaks of itself. It’s magnificent, but to what end? Is it the universe, or merely a permutation?"

"The ultimate labyrinth," Teller murmured, tracing the outlines on the yogurt's surface, "is not in its form but its perception. In the yogurt, shapes transcend; it’s all connected, yet distinct."

Neven sat back, her thoughts a cacophony of suspicion and intrigue. "Why diligent though?"

Teller chuckled, rolling the word in his mouth like a confection. "Because," he said, "it persists beyond consumption. Remove a spoonful, and the labyrinth reconfigures itself. It’s ever-striving to complete the never-complete."

Neven’s inquisitive nature prompted more questions. "And why show this to me? What’s my part in this grand design?"

"To walk with me," Teller answered, his voice a gentle cadence. “As a partner, not a spectator, one who reads the roads and the spaces between them.”

They contemplated each other across vast imaginary landscapes, where words were as tangible as the winding halls between them. Shadows played in their eyes, whispering stories that lived just beyond the conscious grasp.

Neven finally grinned, the glint of adventure kindling bright. "Count me in. Together, we’ll chart new realms of yogurt-mazes, far deeper than any Borges could dream."

As the tendrils of smoke from the yogurt dissipated into the ether, Neven turned sharply to Teller. "But be warned," she quipped, half in jest, "if this ends like one of Borges' tales—"

Before she could finish, the room shivered—a gust of wind, impossibly warm and alive, wrapped through the workshop, extinguishing the flickering lamps. A profound silence fell, ringing louder than Neven's unspoken words.

And thus, as swiftly as a magician’s sleight of hand, the tale of the diligent yogurt—quite unexpectedly—came to its sudden halt, leaving only shadows and whispered secrets behind.
