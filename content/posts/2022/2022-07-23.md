The oppressive air clung to Nathaniel's skin like a damp, heavy shroud as he hesitated before the imposing manor. The old estate was a relic of a bygone era, its grandeur eroded by decades of neglect. Murmurs had reached Nathaniel about the place being haunted, but it was the sad story of a woman known as the '悲伤的speaker' that drew him here. His fascination with the supernatural was both a curse and a calling.

"Are you sure about this?" whispered Michael, Nathaniel's reluctant companion, his voice tinged with unease.

Nathaniel shrugged, his eyes fixed on the shadowy windows. "We need to understand what happened here. The truth is hidden behind these walls."

As they stepped inside, the chill of the manor seeped into their bones. The entrance hall stretched before them, its expansive ceiling casting eerie echoes as if the voices of the past lingered in the very air.

"Look," Nathaniel gestured towards a portrait, its subject a woman with downcast eyes, eternally trapped in her sorrowful gaze. "That’s her."

Michael swallowed, trying to suppress his rising panic. "Do you think she’s still here?"

"She never left," Nathaniel replied solemnly, his voice revealing a mix of anticipation and dread.

Their footsteps reverberated as they explored further into the house, each creak of the floorboards resonating like whispered secrets in the gloom. Suddenly, a low murmur slithered through the shadows, seizing their attention. Nathaniel’s heart raced, the sound chillingly familiar.

“Do you hear that?” Nathaniel asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Michael nodded, clutching his flashlight as though it were a lifeline. "It’s coming from the walls."

The sad, mournful voice seemed to seep through the woodwork, an elusive whisper that teased their senses. Nathaniel pressed his ear to the faded wallpaper, feeling the vibration of the sorrowful speaker’s lament.

“Who are you?” he called out, his words a tentative bridge to the ethereal.

Silence followed, thick and foreboding, until it was shattered by a soft, sorrow-laden response. “Lost,” the word echoed, a single note of despair.

“Why can't you leave?” Nathaniel implored, his determination fueled by the inexplicable connection he felt with the voice.

“Bound to the past… forgotten…” the reply floated around them, a ghostly poltergeist charged with emotion.

Michael shuddered, his resolve weakening under the oppressive weight of the speaker’s sorrow. “This is madness, Nathaniel. We need to go.”

But Nathaniel shook his head, his eyes alight with a fervor that bordered on obsession. "Not until we help her," he insisted, his conviction unyielding.

The dialogue between them and the unseen soul continued, a haunting melody of questions and revelations. Piece by piece, the tragic tale of the '悲伤的speaker' unfolded—a tale of betrayal, love lost to the cruelty of time, and an unbroken chain that tethered her spirit to the present.

Yet, as the evening wore on, Nathaniel felt an unsettling change in the air. The house seemed to breathe, its aged walls alive and listening. It was then that the chilling truth began to cement itself—what if the house didn’t want them to leave? What if the house had cultivated its own sinister attachment to the story?

As the first rays of dawn crept through the manor’s dusty windows, the voice fell silent. Nathaniel, now alone with his thoughts, whispered a promise to return, to uncover more. Yet, as he and Michael stepped into the dawn’s tentative light, a chilling realization rooted itself in his mind—was the sadness that lingered here born of the past, or had it fed insatiably on their overwhelming desire to find answers?

“Until next time,” the house seemed to murmur, a promise that sent a shiver racing down Nathaniel’s spine.

Would they ever truly leave?

A question left suspended, inviting reflection and dread.
