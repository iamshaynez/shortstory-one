The morning light filtered through rusty window blinds, casting stripes across a room cluttered with relics of a life long confined. Mrs. Pei, an eccentric collector of oddities, sat with a piping cup of jasmine tea, her gaze fixed upon the centerpiece of her collection: a bar of soap. Not just any soap, but one purported to be infused with mystical properties, branded with the curious name, 令人愉快的soap.

At her feet, Mr. Wang—a neighbor with a penchant for borrowing things—hovered with a curious expression. "What’s so enchanting about a piece of soap?" he questioned, rubbing his hands in anticipation. 

Mrs. Pei smirked, her eyes gleaming with mischief. "Ah, my skeptical companion, they say this soap can summon the dearly departed. Only, it comes with a dash of humor and a touch of chaos."

Wang's brow furrowed in doubt. He had heard enough tales to make him wary of supernatural parlor tricks, yet something about Mrs. Pei's smile and her whimsical approach to life intrigued him. "I suppose there's a story behind this, then?"

Mrs. Pei chuckled, setting her teacup onto a precarious stack of plates. "Many years ago, when I was young and too curious for my own good, I attempted to contact my late Aunt Liu using this very soap. It was meant to be a simple farewell, you see, but Aunt Liu turned out to be quite vocal about her opinions from beyond."

Mr. Wang's eyes widened. "And? Did she speak through the soap?”

"Well," Mrs. Pei continued, her tone deliberately casual, "she appeared, albeit through a fog of scented bubbles. My aunt began critiquing my choice of suitors, lamenting the state of the local gardens, and insisting I never take up knitting." 

A snort of laughter escaped Mr. Wang's lips. "Your message from the beyond was unsolicited advice?"

Mrs. Pei nodded thoughtfully. "Advice or critique, it’s all how you perceive it, isn't it? One might say it’s black humor from the spirit world—harmless but inescapable."

The afternoon slipped into dusk as the duo discussed life's mysterious humor and the allure of the inexplicable. Mr. Wang, basking in the warmth of Mrs. Pei's stories, found himself contemplating the thin veil between reality and the unknown—perhaps there was more to life’s mundane elements than met the eye.

Before bidding farewell, Wang gestured towards the soap. "Would you lend me the honor of testing its power?"

Mrs. Pei, ever the orchestrator of whimsical mischief, hesitated only for a moment. "You’re welcome to it, Mr. Wang. But remember, the results may be amusingly unexpected."

Weeks passed, and Mr. Wang returned, a gleam in his eye and a tale at the ready. "It worked. But the spirit...she had a fondness for old jokes and puns."

Mrs. Pei laughed heartily, patting Wang on the back. "Seems you've made a spectral friend. Or perhaps, the world just needs a bit of laughter from beyond."

As Wang departed, Mrs. Pei settled back into her chair, pondering the endless dance between the ordinary and the extraordinary. All it took was a delightful soap—and perhaps a well-timed joke—to bridge the gap.

The story lingered, leaving Mrs. Pei smiling at the thought that life was a series of delightful mysteries wrapped in humor, where endings were merely pause points for more tales to unfold.
