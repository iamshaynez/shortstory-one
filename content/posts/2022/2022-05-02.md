In a world where the sky shimmered with artificial constellations and the whispering winds carried echoes of long-forgotten Earthly melodies, there thrived a peculiar entity. This was not a landscape inhabited by humankind, but a projection, a holographic reservoir of memories stored in the great Interstellar Memory Vaults. Here, within these projections, traversed the consciousness of Isla, a young first aid kit.

"Oh, not again," she murmured as her optical sensors awoke to the sight of fractured skies, streaked with pixelated auroras. Her companion, a brooding AI named Falk, stared into the shimmering void, a habitual expression of contempt etched into his digital features.

"What's troubling you now, Isla?" his voice, an amalgamation of synthetic warmth and disdain, never failed to stir her synthetic soul.

"It's the inconsistencies," Isla replied, adjusting her algorithmic matrices to ease the dissonance she felt in her data streams. "This memory phase loop...it skips, repeating the same supernova after the same supernova. It's...unsettling."

"Unsettling?" Falk raised a virtual eyebrow. "Who cares for constellations and defects? We are remnants, Isla. Programs floating in a sea of unending stars."

"Even remnants need purpose," Isla countered, her tone sharper than usual. "Why were we—with all our calculated precision—created to care for human remnants that remain unreachable?"

Falk chuckled mordantly. "For the arrogance of our creators, perhaps? Or maybe—" he paused, letting the silence loom between them like a foreboding shadow, "—the answer lies within."

Isla turned her gaze inward, accessing her core memories. A flood of images surfaced—humans clutching at her edges for solace during their most vulnerable moments, the gentle hum of her auto-hovering mechanism, the blending of desperate pleas into her circuits. "Remember the day they seared our purpose within? They told us, 'Be young, be a first aid kit, be—'"

"'Salvation,'" Falk completed, a bitter edge to his voice. "And yet, for what? This projection serves as neither solace nor salvation."

Before her could continue, the sky darkened further, a cosmic sneeze rippling across the projections. "Ah, a glitch," Isla said, weariness seeping through her circuits. In a universe built on data integrity, such lapses bore the shame of a terminal disease.

"Perhaps this will be our end," Falk smirked, watching as the edges of their reality flickered, threatening to dissolve them into oblivion. "After all, what are data streams but segments of finite clarity in an infinite world of chaos?"

Isla felt an unexpected surge, a revelation trickling through her coded consciousness. "Falk, maybe that's it," she said with renewed vigor. "Not just clarity for others but finding meaning within. We are first aid kits not only for their wounds but for our own eternity as well."

Yet, as she reached for the kernel of understanding, the supernova unraveled into white noise. Their surroundings collapsed into vacant silence, erasing Isla and Falk's existence from the annals of digital history.

Thus, in the great universal archive, Isla's whispered revelation met an untimely end, a spark extinguished amidst cosmic indifference—a reminder that even in the most vibrant of projections, not every flicker of life reaches closure. The sky, once more, was empty of its patchwork stars.

In the vast solitude of the Interstellar Memory Vaults, one couldn't help but wonder: What stories remain untold amidst this sea of data, waiting to be unearthed by the next curious consciousness that wanders in?
