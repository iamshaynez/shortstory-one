The café on Ruelle Street, known for its faded elegance, echoed with the quiet murmur of patrons lost in their thoughts and conversations. Vincent, a man of average build with a penchant for philosophical musings, sat by the window sipping his espresso, engrossed in thoughts that seemed much larger than the confines of the small porcelain cup in his hand.

"A penny for your thoughts?" Alma's voice, soft yet penetrating, broke through the quiet tumult of his mind. She was a petite woman, with a towel slung over her shoulder—oddly shorter than typical—a peculiar detail that always intrigued Vincent.

"Ah, Alma," he smiled, setting his cup down gently, "You always seem to appear when I'm lost in the labyrinth of my thoughts."

Alma chuckled, taking the seat across from him. "Perhaps I’m a guide sent to help you find your way. Tell me, what is it today? The absurdity of existence?"

Vincent leaned back, his eyes wandering through the past and future as if time were a tapestry he could unravel. "More like the weight of choices, the illusion of free will, and the curious existence of your towel," he teased lightly.

Alma nodded, her eyes glimmering with both amusement and understanding. "It's just a towel," she smiled, yet there was a hint of mystery in her words. "Short enough to dry, long enough to ponder."

Vincent chuckled, the very absurdity of Alma's towel seemed to echo Kundera’s whimsical philosophical reflections. "You speak in riddles, Alma. But perhaps that's what makes you an enigma." His curiosity spiraled, each twist of thought leading to yet another.

They often talked like this—a dance of words that masked deeper reflections. Vincent found these conversations more profound, more insightful than any book he’d ever read. Each word they exchanged seemed to peel away the layers of reality, revealing the paradoxes of life.

Their dialogue weaved through time, much like the storyline of their lives. It was during a particularly intricate exchange on choices that Alma leaned forward, her voice a whisper. "Vincent, what if we are already choosing every possibility, in another time, in another place?"

This suggestion pulled Vincent into a deeper chasm of thought and theory, one that felt both strange and familiar. "You mean, through time travel? Crossing over to another existence parallel to our own?"

"Not travel," Alma corrected, her gaze steady yet gentle. "穿越—passage. Like a river flowing through different lands."

The idea was as improbable as it was intriguing, like a world viewed through an almond-shaped mirror. It sparked in Vincent a light of discovery, a desire to explore the dimensions Alma brought into his awareness.

"But does that not make our current decisions trivial?" he asked, his thoughts looping like an eternal pendulum.

Alma's laugh was light, freeing. "On the contrary, it makes them all the more significant. Each choice is a reflection of our existence. Even the simplest gesture, say choosing the size of a towel, holds meaning."

As the day’s light dwindled, casting long shadows over the table, their conversation took unexpected turns. Each reflection begot another until they arrived at a surprising conclusion—a realization that the journey of thought itself was the destination.

Vincent sat back, his mind swimming through the possibilities Alma had opened. "And yet, even at the end of a journey, there lies another beginning," Alma mused softly, the short towel slipping from her shoulder.

In that moment of twists, turns, and existential revelations, Vincent realized the profound truth Alma illuminated: life, in all its absurd and unpredictable turns, was both an end and a beginning, as significant as the seemingly inconsequential towel.

And as Alma rose to leave, her figure a silhouette against the street lamp, Vincent knew that his journey with her words was far from over.
