The sky over Orion Court shimmered with soft twilight hues, casting an ethereal glow onto the elderly woman sitting by her shop window. The shop, Timeframes & Trinkets, nestled between the towering steel structures, housed a collection of ancient jewelry, each piece whispering tales of bygone eras.

Mara, the keeper of these tales, peered through her spectacles, her fingers tracing the intricate patterns of a locket. Her eyes gleamed with the knowledge of centuries, borne by her unique connection to what she called 'the cycle,’ where beginnings and endings merged seamlessly.

"And how much for that there brooch?" interrupted a curious voice, intoning with a mix of reverence and skepticism.

Mara looked up, her gaze meeting that of a tall man with silvery hair standing in the doorway. His presence was both commanding and gentle.

"Ah, you've found her," Mara replied, her voice gentle as the dawn, gesturing to the brooch. "That's not for sale, Mr. DeVries. It chooses its own place in time."

DeVries chuckled softly, feeling a sense of destiny inexplicably linked to the brooch. "Are all your pieces like that? With tales as grand as their glamour?"

"Indeed," Mara said, offering him a seat. "Each one is a fragment of our world's grand tapestry."

As shadows lengthened, under the soft illumination of aged lamps, Mara wove tales. DeVries listened, enraptured, as her melodic voice transformed simple descriptions into transcendent imagery. She spoke not of historical events, but of moments – fleeting instants caught in the delicate clasp of a necklace or the sturdy band of a ring.

"But what of the locket you're so fond of?" DeVries asked, gesturing to Mara's earlier subject of fascination.

"It's not just any locket," Mara said, a wistful nostalgia in her tone. "It's said to hold a secret of the stars, a story of beginnings."

DeVries leaned in, his curiosity piqued. "And what story does it tell? If time could speak...?"

Mara paused, her gaze drifting beyond the confines of their small corner of the universe, as if scanning the vastness of the cosmos. "It tells of rebirth," she said finally, "of lives intertwined across time. A necklace worn by a queen, later found by a traveler. A ring, symbolizing unity in one age, finding its pair in another."

"And where does that leave us, dear Mara? In this dance of time?"

"Right where we are, in the moment, both beginning and end," she said, her smile gentle and assured. "In the cycle."

An unexpected breeze stirred the room, the setting sun casting a flicker through the shop, as DeVries gazed at her, the air pregnant with a curious magic. The brooch he inquired about seemed to pulse with life, as if acknowledging its destined path.

"Perhaps," DeVries mused thoughtfully, "in another time, I was the one seated here, and you there."

Mara chuckled warmly, "Perhaps, Mr. DeVries. The cycle binds us all in its inexorable flow."

As the world outside shifted from sunset to dusk, DeVries stood, touching the air next to the brooch in farewell. "Until next time, Mara."

"Until then," she replied, her words a gentle caress, promising continuity in the revolving dance of existence.

Stepping out into the night, DeVries felt the familiar oddity of déjà vu, as if time itself had briefly winked at him, leaving the echoes of the cycle to resonate within his soul. With each step, he felt the weight of endless beginnings and the buoyancy of infinite ends, bound in the mysterious jewel of the universe itself.
