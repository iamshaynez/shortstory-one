In the bustling office of the small publishing company, Lizandro wrestled with his existential discontent, a soft scent of hand sanitizer perpetually lingering in the air—a testament to the relentless pursuit of sterility in a world tainted by moral disarray. He often pondered the phantom distinction between reality and dreams, sipping espresso in the early hours with the office's ancient coffeemaker wheezing its caffeine-laden breath.

“Lizandro, I need those files by noon,” called Rosa, his manager—a woman whose authority seemed as anchored in her vibrant red lipstick as in her decades of unyielding tenure. Her voice echoed, resonating with an unseen weight of life's claimed victories and subtle defeats.

“Yes, Rosa. I'll have them ready,” Lizandro replied, masking his inner longing for a life less mundane behind a courteous nod. His desk overflowed with manuscripts pleading for his attention—a cacophony of unrealized dreams, much like his own.

In this realm, time moved with a curious elasticity, as if obeying a rhythm known only to the distant hum of ceiling fans and the occasional chirp of unseen tropical birds, a reminder of the lush landscapes framing the city.

Maria, a new recruit with a penchant for probing questions, often sought sanctuary by Lizandro's desk. Her eyes bore the curiosity of a child yet sugared with the courage of someone who had tasted freedom from her native land’s hardships. “Do you ever wonder,” she mused one afternoon, “if the characters in these stories ever know they are bound by the pages?”

Lizandro leaned back, contemplating the universe within the ink-stained pages. “Sometimes, I think we are no different. Bound by chapters we did not write, yet longing for plot twists that might free us.”

Their camaraderie grew through whispered soliloquies and shared silences, crafting a bond that was curiously liberating amidst the weariness of editorial life. Maria's presence, a vibrant kaleidoscope amidst muted grays, enkindled a flicker of hope in Lizandro’s weary heart.

But these gentle interludes of connection were shadowed by Rosa’s descents into the realms of unreason, marked by her insistent tapping—a reminder of the unwritten company law prioritizing productivity over humanity. Lizandro and Maria often sneaked away to the rooftop garden, a pocket of Eden adorned by fragrant blooms salvaged from their boss’s budget cuts.

“Lizandro,” Maria whispered one late afternoon as they sat amidst the blossoms, the sun’s descent painting the sky with hues of melancholy anticipation, “we must find our stories. Before there are none left to tell.”

Yet, Maria’s words would echo beyond her brief tenure; for her departure was as abrupt as a tropical storm, a whirlwind of bureaucratic red tape and opaque letters that claimed redundancy in the name of efficiency.

Rosa’s demeanour remained as firm and impeccably painted, unaffected by the ripples of Maria's absence. Lizandro, however, felt the void like an unhealed wound, his own spirit too numbed by indifference to rebel.

The scent of hand sanitizer lingered—a mocking reminder of cleansing unattained, stories unexplored. Lizandro continued editing tales of far-off lands from the confines of his desk, the inked leashes of reality binding his dreams to the perennial cycle of the office clock.

In the end, it was an elegy of potential unfulfilled, dreams untold, lives bound by the rigid frames of a narrative never wholly theirs. The tragic end lay not in a single cataclysmic event but in the slow, inevitable erosion of hope.

The office, much like life, carried on—untouched by Lizandro's hidden anguish and the silent echoes of countless unfinished stories. Only the soft scent of hand sanitizer lingered, a gentle ghost amid the whispers of untold possibilities.
