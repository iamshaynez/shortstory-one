"Claudia, have you looked beyond the corner stall?" Margot's voice echoed in the dimly lit bathroom, the air tinged with both intrigue and disbelief.

"The corner stall?" replied Claudia, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her cardigan, a distant quiver in her voice. She approached it cautiously, her footsteps subdued by curiosity and a strange compulsion.

"You always did shy away from mysteries," teased Margot, her laughter like sunlight filtering through dense foliage. "But this one... it's different."

Claudia sighed, resting her hand on the chipped, wooden door. Her reflection stared back, eyes wide, mouth slightly agape, as if imploring her to venture within. "I suppose we should, shouldn't we? It's not every day you hear of a... a rare toilet."

Margot nodded, her excitement palpable. "Exactly! A rare toilet that supposedly bends time and reality. It's like stepping into Woolf's flowing consciousness, each thought and feeling weaving into the tapestry of the universe."

"Virginia Woolf would have had a field day with this," Claudia mused, pushing open the door. The interior shimmered oddly, walls pulsating with colors unseen by mortal eyes. She hesitated, exhaling softly as she crossed the threshold, Margot trailing behind like an eager specter.

Inside, everything was inexplicably vibrant. The white porcelain gleamed, whispering ancient secrets in a dialect only the soul could decipher. Margot darted forward, running her hand along its surface. "Do you feel that? It's as if we're on the brink of everywhere and nowhere."

Claudia shook her head, an internal tide swept her to childhood memories, forgotten dreams blending seamlessly with the present. "Time’s slipping, Margot. I feel... I feel like I’m merging with... with the essence of everything."

The room contorted, bending space and perception. Margot gripped Claudia's arm, her eyes narrowing against the dazzling light. "Perhaps this is Woolf's idea of crossing through, of experiencing all the world's moments at once."

They sat, transfixed, as the toilet hummed with potential, offering glimpses into lives unlived. Joys basked in luminescence, grief shrouded in deep, melancholic shadows. Here was the essence of humanity — raw, unfiltered, terrifyingly beautiful.

"I'm afraid," Claudia admitted, her voice barely more than a whisper. "Afraid of what could be, what might have been."

Margot squeezed her hand, a comforting anchor amid the cosmic storm. "But isn't that what it means to live? To dance upon the precipice of joy and sorrow, to acknowledge the brevity and intensity of our moments?"

The brilliance receded, their minds returning to the present. They stared at each other, tears mingling with laughter, heavy yet somehow liberated.

"It's ironic," Claudia chuckled, wiping her eyes. "Who knew a toilet could teach us so much about life?"

Margot grinned, standing up, her spirit invigorated. "Sometimes, the rarest places reveal the most profound truths. Perhaps Woolf was right — life is a series of impressions and introspections, each echoing the infinite complexity of our universe."

Claudia nodded, turning towards the door. With one last glance, she murmured, "Bittersweet, isn't it? What we've seen, what we've experienced."

"Yes," Margot agreed, linking arms with Claudia as they stepped back into the mundane hum of reality. "But isn't that the beauty of it all?"

As the door closed behind them, the rare toilet sighed, biding its time until the next pair of seekers dared to explore its secrets, to lose and find themselves within its enigmatic embrace.
