In the hushed corridors of Haverfield Academy, where sunlight filtered through leaf-stained windows, Michael found himself again pondering his peculiar attachment to the old, flexible bed. "It's absurd, really," he mused aloud, eyeing its creaking frame, an heirloom passed dutifully through generations of boarding school students.

"Absurd? That's putting it lightly," scoffed Clara, his roommate, flashing him a teasing grin. "You talk about that thing as if it’s alive."

Michael chuckled, more a rumble of exhalation that filled the silence between them. "Alive? No, it's just... it's seen things, you know?"

Clara sat back in her chair, curiosity piquing her eccentricity. Her vibrant personality had a habit of painting the dull academy canvas in splashes of color. "So it's like a diary? An inanimate confidant of boring school secrets?"

"Perhaps," he replied, glancing at the bed's unremarkable beige cover. "It's just... flexible. Has a way of bending to life's necessities."

Their conversation drifted into a comfortable quietude, the kind only those who have shared countless mundane moments can enjoy. Outside, autumn leaves whispered secrets of their own.

**“Do you think our lives will change as quickly as this?”** asked Clara suddenly, gesturing to the window. Her hair caught a rogue beam of light, revealing strands of unexpected gold amidst her somber brown waves.

Michael leaned back, staring at the ceiling as if it held answers. "Don't they always? Maybe that's why I stay in this room year after year; the bed's my anchor."

"You mean, you don't stay for me?" she joked, though her voice held a slight edge, one Michael didn't miss.

He met her eyes, laughing softly. "Let's say seventy-thirty. The bed wins by a squeak."

Their laughter mingled with the afternoon sun, both aware yet content to ignore the approaching end of their shared chapters. Life at Haverfield was an amalgam of such moments; fleeting, yet memorably etched onto their hearts.

Weeks passed, and as Michael meticulously packed his belongings, that old bed seemed for once, bothersome, with its constant demands to be dismantled, reassembled, coaxed into compliance. Clara watched from the doorway, her disdain for melancholic goodbyes painted on each wave of her goodbye.

"I never thought I’d see the end of your infamous love affair with the bed," she remarked, hinting at cheerfulness despite their impending separation.

Michael shrugged indifferently, his hands lingering on the well-worn edges. "Life goes on. It has to."

He left the room, each step heavy with unsaid goodbyes. The bed remained behind—silent, unyielding, a paradox of surrender and immutability.

Days and months stretched silently. Michael's new city life embraced him in unfamiliarity until a casual note arrived from Clara, bruised by ink and affection. "You know," it read, "I always thought you'd find another weird bed in Cambridge. Hope your new one’s just as flexible."

A smile found Michael easily—a slow twinge of nostalgia mixed with the promise of new beginnings. Scribbling his reply, he assured her, "None quite like that. You and that bed were one of a kind. I think I miss you both."

Their correspondence continued, a narrative of changes and constants, echoing their time spent together under Haverfield's partly-cloudy skies. In their absence, the bed awaited another narrative to cradle—a relic, resting yet restless, as students scurried past its proffered wisdom.

And thus, life moved on, both heart and home surpassed by the swift turns of fate—an end that started, a farewell perpetually lingering yet never fully said.
