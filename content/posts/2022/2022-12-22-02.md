In the heart of the Deep South, where cypress trees wept into murky waters and shadows whispered secrets long buried, stood an old, rickety mansion. Inside its mold-speckled libraries and echoing hallways, a family cursed by time awaited their destiny. They were the remote Eccles family, once revered but now forgotten, their souls tethered to the haunted walls of their decaying home. 

Anna Eccles, the youngest of their lineage, had a curious spirit that burned brighter than the wilting candles lining the drawing room. Her eyes mirrored the silvery waters of the bayou, restless and shimmering with untold stories. She spent her days turning over forgotten stones, caught between seeking freedom and understanding the enigmatic curse that bound her kin.

Her brother, James, was a brooding figure. His presence within the house was like the weight of humid air before a storm—intense, suffocating. His voice, rarely heard, often wrapped itself around the end of each day like gathering clouds. In moments when silence expanded between them, the air would tremble as if alive with murmurs of unseen realms.

One afternoon, as thunderheads gathered and distant foreboding rumbled, Anna stumbled upon a peculiar book bristling with dust. Its cover bore the faded inscription, “Record of Short-Lived Worlds.” Her heart drummed with anticipation as she opened it, the leather spine cracking open to reveal worlds that blinked in and out of existence, shown only to those who sought their fleeting nature—a brief respite away from the curse of enduring transience. 

Anna whispered the book's title under her breath, as if daring it to reveal its mysteries: “短暂的remote.” The words floated past her lips like the breeze tickling willow branches, intertwining her fate with realms she could scarcely imagine. 

As night fell, Anna found herself absorbed by dialogues between ethereal realms, her voice serving as both narrator and participant. “These worlds, James,” she breathed, hope cloaked within her words, “are like us—ghostly, visible only in flashes, seen by those who are willing to look beyond the veil. Aren't they beautiful?”

“Beautiful?” James echoed, bitterness threading his tone. “Beautiful becomes tragic when it flutters away like dust. When it leaves nothing but the sharp edge of longing.”

“But isn’t that life?” Anna's insistence bore a fragile determination, like moonlight sifting through Spanish moss—visible yet intangible. “We linger, we yearn, but maybe… maybe even the fleeting leaves a mark worth cherishing.”

For a moment, silence cocooned them. The house, quiet and ominous, seemed to hold its breath. James turned away, shadows swallowing his retreating form, leaving Anna to ponder the selves they had become.

Long after flames sputtered in their sconces, sleep claimed Anna, her dreams woven with the delicate colors of a world always remote, eternally ephemeral. In her waking hours, she would share these visions with her brother, brushing them with luminescent strokes of whispered hues. Each word, a fragile shard to fill the emptiness that marked their history.

Days turned into nights, threaded with unresolved dialogues that painted their reality with the colors of distant worlds—a short-lived beauty riddled with the ache of impermanence. Yet within the whispered pages Anna had unlocked, the Eccles siblings found solace—a bittersweet understanding that even within the briefest of glimpses, there was a story worth telling.

And so they remained, both bound and freed by the remote tales of a whispered world, the memory of their conversation lingering long after the worlds themselves faded into shadow.
