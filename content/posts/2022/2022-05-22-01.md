Under the sprawling skies of New Mexico, a small town whispers tales of forgotten dreams and hidden treasures. The sun sets the dusty horizon ablaze, casting shadows over a modest saloon where the day's toils are washed away with whiskey and camaraderie. In a corner, under flickering lamplight, sits Jack “Hammer” Morgan, a man of few words and many stories. His presence, like that of an immovable mountain, commands respect.

Jack, with the weathered skin of one who has seen too much sun, grips a pair of drum sticks. Not just any drum sticks, mind you, but a peculiar set engraved with cryptic markings. Independent from any drum, they are his pen, his sword, his independence. He taps a rhythm only he seems to hear, one that speaks of unspoken battles and victories yet to claim.

Next to him, still sipping from her amber-filled glass, is Eliza Wells. Her auburn hair cascades over her shoulders like rivers of fire. Her laughter is rare but when it comes, it strikes like the first thunder of spring. Eliza, the widow of a man who never returned from the war, has an eye for the unyielding and a heart that beats in time with Jack’s silent drumming.

“Jack, you ever gonna tell me the story behind those sticks?” Eliza prods, her voice teasing yet carrying an undercurrent of genuine curiosity.

Jack pauses, the drum sticks poised as if about to conduct a symphony, “They’re just sticks, El. Part of me now.”

Eliza leans closer, her eyes narrowing playfully, “Part of you, sure. But there’s more, isn’t there?”

He shrugs, offering her none of the tale. His silence spoken in volumes, much like the Hemingway characters who wield power in their reticence.

The night unfolds, the saloon’s ambience a mix of clinking glasses and murmurs of broken dreams. Entering the scene is Billy Reed, a young cowboy with an eager smile and ambition etched across his brow.

“Jack,” Billy calls out, his boots echoing on the wooden floor, “heard you were the best trapper this side of the Pecos.”

“Rumors grow tall out here, Billy,” Jack replies, his hand gently tapping the sticks again.

“What if I offered a deal? My ranch’s got varmints mighty clever. Could use someone who knows the lay better than the Beast of Babylon himself.”

Silence stretches out, like a rubber band, ready to snap. Jack’s gaze meets Billy’s, weighing the offer against an unseeable scale. “We catch ‘em, it’s your shout at the saloon,” Jack says, at last, a twinkle in his eye.

“Deal!” Billy exclaims, his handshake firm and spirited, sealing the unspoken pact.

The saloon’s murmur transforms into songs of laughter, a harmonic discord in the Western night. Shadows dance with the lantern light, and the small town, with its people of simple accord, finds its cadence in the midst of forgotten dreams.

As the moon hangs high and serene, Jack’s rhythm remains, echoing in the wind—timeless, independent, like the heartbeat of the West. Eliza joins in the laughter, the warmth of the night wrapping around as Jack and his companions bask in the present, unworried by the past or future, bound only by the beats of independent drum sticks and the community they quietly nurture.

A big, harmonious ending after all.
