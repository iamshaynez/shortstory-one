In a small, nondescript Western town, obscured by dust and time, Simon stood facing the enigmatic creature of his daily torment: an overly enthusiastic hair dryer. Its excited hum filled the room, drowning out the ambient sounds of life beyond his apartment walls. 

“Simon,” it purred, the sound somehow carrying a tinge of glee. “Today’s the day. Aren’t you thrilled?”

Simon, a man worn by the ticking clock of fate, simply sighed. His reflection peered back at him from the mirror—a face lined with impatience at the absurdity of it all. He ran a weary hand through thinning hair, contemplating the surreal dialogue with a device that shouldn’t talk back.

“Thrilled? That’s one word for it,” he replied, recalling the strange fortune teller’s words: “Your destiny is as unavoidable as gravity.”

The hair dryer cackled, a high-pitched laugh that only added to its bizarre nature. “Yes, gravity! It pulls us all, doesn’t it? But today, you face the ultimate choice.”

Simon couldn’t remember when it became normal to have conversations with appliances, but in this Kafkaesque reality, it was as if everyone simply accepted the absurd roles imposed upon them. The dryer’s jubilation only magnified Simon’s dread.

Across town, in a quaint café, Sophia sat stirring her coffee nervously. Her hopes and dreams were constants in a life where destinies crossed in unexpected junctions. She pondered her next steps and whether Simon would finally defy his monotonous existence.

“I wonder if he’ll show,” she mused aloud, half hoping for an answer from the silence that enveloped the wake of morning traffic.

An old, scruffy bystander replied unprompted, “Men like him usually don’t. They’re too wrapped in their own fates.”

Sophia nodded solemnly. “But isn’t that why they disappoint themselves repeatedly?”

Back in his tiny abode, Simon dressed with care, considering the words from the night before. A chance to rebel—a calling to attend the meeting that could change it all, or simply remain in his cycle. The dryer’s hum grew louder, resonating with a manic energy filling Simon’s head like the buzzing of discontent.

With each step toward the door, he felt as though he carried the weight of destiny, an inevitable conclusion wrapped tightly around him. In the hallway, time stretched endlessly, trapping him within its absurd logic. As he reached the stairwell, the walls seemed to breathe, whispering tales of the endless—repetitive—escape attempts.

Downstairs, Sophia’s watchful eyes followed each passerby, measuring hope against reality. Her thoughts turned inward, to what truly drove the decisions they all feared making.

“Why wait for him? It’s futile.” The phrase from a fellow patron startled her out of her brooding silence.

With a deep breath, Simon finally emerged onto the bustling street, the town's indifferent churning mirroring the chaos within. He glimpsed the café, saw Sophia. A longing, shared and understood, flickered between them. Yet, here stood the moment—the crossroad forged long ago by intangible threads of fate.

In that fleeting instance, amidst the cacophony of choice and destiny, the hair dryer’s enthusiastic voice echoed in his mind, urging him toward the future, while the weight of serenely woven fates bore heavily upon his heart.

“Today, or never,” it urged again.

Simon hesitated, feeling the impact of his decision resonate through the hazy air, the unyielding certainty of fate binding him tighter with every ticking second.

And then, with a resigned sigh, he turned away, surrendering to the absurd dance orchestrated by a universe that never intended for him to stray.

“Well,” Sophia murmured to herself, sipping her now-cold coffee with the bitterness of realization settling in. “It seems gravity wins again.”

The street swallowed Simon whole, a solitary figure drifting into the mundane canvas of existence, as the relentless hum of destiny continued its unwavering tune.
