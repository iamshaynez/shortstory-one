The city pulsed with a rhythm as mindful and relentless as the ocean tides. Alicia, standing on the rain-slick pavement, gazed at the neon lights reflecting off the glass-clad facades like constellations in a sky that had forgotten stars. She hunched her shoulders against the drizzle, her coat of faded polyester clinging clammy and unrelenting, like a memory she couldn't quite shake.

"Salty, isn't it?" remarked an old man who shuffled beside her, his grin as cracked and enduring as the city itself. 

"Excuse me?" Alicia replied, her thoughts still lingering somewhere between the raindrops racing down window panes.

"Your coat. Polyester, a fabric of endurance, but not without its cost. It absorbs the world," he winked, "like dreams forgotten in a downpour."

Alicia laughed, the sound a rare bird in the concrete jungle. "I suppose you're right," she answered, inspecting her coat anew. It seemed to hold the city within its threads, a tapestry of rain and dirt woven with threads of somber gray.

The old man, whose name was revealed in subsequent conversations as Herbert, became something of an unexpected guide for Alicia. He had lived many lives and bore witness to the city as if chronicling an epic. "You see, everything here is connected," he imparted one afternoon as they watched the effervescent cityscape from a cozy café. "Like the veins of a leaf, always reaching, always searching for light amidst the smog."

Their dialogue often drifted through alleys of laughter, curiosity, and occasional melancholy, weaving their thoughts into a narrative as grand yet intimate as a Melville story. Herbert was a master of metaphor, each conversation with him a microcosm of the city's tales, its triumphs veiled in tragedy, longings serenaded by the symphony of a million footsteps. 

Over time, Alicia found herself pondering Herbert's philosophy. "Can something so mundane as polyester indeed mirror human experience?" she mused aloud, nibbling thoughtfully on her pencil as raindrops tap-danced on the café’s windows.

Herbert nodded sagely, "Absolutely, my dear! Polyester is life itself, resilient yet tarnished by the very life it endures. Cities are like that, too—a splash of innovation washed over with the gritty residue of existence."

In the depths of their final conversation, when words were dipped in the deepest shades of blue, Alicia shared her own burdens, the invisible weights she bore. Herbert listened, his silent understanding as comforting as a lighthouse’s glow through the fog. "You wear life as it comes," he finally observed, "Rain or shine."

As Alicia parted from Herbert one gusty evening, she paused on the cusp of a crosswalk, the city's breath a heavy hum around her. Realization nestled in; the city, like her coat, was both armor and anthology. Through a symbolically lucid metamorphosis, she understood that her old coat of polyester, though steeped in the city’s essence, was now imbued with her own narratives, ones of survival and courage, dreams and forgotten raindrops.

Standing beneath the cascading rain, she glimpsed her reflection distorted in pedestrian puddles—an endless cycle caught in a symbolic moment. She stepped forward, her heart alight, leaving footprints that melted into the rain as she walked on, a melody in the city's grand sonata, both salty and sweet.

Herbert merely tipped his hat, watching the symphonic city enfold her within its embrace—a testament to a city where stories were embodied in every thread, each soul part of a greater weaving, as infinitely enduring as the polyester windbreaker she wore with pride.
