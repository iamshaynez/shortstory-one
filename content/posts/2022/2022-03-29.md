The rain had begun its delicate symphony, tapping gently on the small round window of Emile's apartment. Beneath its rhythmic whisper, the city seemed to breathe a soft sigh, as if lamenting the passage of some forgotten time. Emile stood there, his gaze lost in the streets below where people, like scattered leaves, moved in all directions, clutching umbrellas of varying colors against them.

"Have you ever walked in the rain without an umbrella?" asked Lena, her voice barely rising above the hush of the water outside. She was settling into the comfort of the armchair, her fingers looped lazily around a teacup, steam curling upwards like the gentle smoke from some distant nostalgia.

Emile turned, letting the weight of her question hang in the air like the dampness of the room. He paused, his hesitation speaking more than any hurried words could. "Once, when I was a child," he replied finally, his voice tinged with an undeniable yearning. "I felt free then, really free. But that was long ago."

Lena smiled, her eyes tracing the contours of Emile's face as if searching for remnants of the boy he once was. "It's funny how rain can bring us back," she murmured, setting down her cup with a soft clink. "But, perhaps, it's not just the rain, hm?"

There, half-hidden beneath a heap of daily newspapers and unread books, lay a dog leash—a forlorn relic of a past brighter than the one cast by the looming gray. Its leather was worn, attempting to hold memories of playful frolics long abandoned. The sight of it was a splash of melancholy amidst the warm glow of his apartment. It was, after all, a 悲伤的dog leash.

Lena's eyes followed Emile's to the leash. "Do you still dream of him?" she asked, her question carrying the weight of understanding only years of companionship could bear.

The room seemed to contract around Emile's exhale. His relationship with that leash was more than mere nostalgia. It spoke of loss, of moments that refused to fade, just like the brush of rain upon his window. "Sometimes," he admitted, each syllable a step back into remembered longing. "He was my anchor then when so little made sense."

"He still anchors you, doesn't he?" Lena's words were not accusatory but tender, carrying the gentleness of a friend who had walked beside him through the fires of loss and healing.

Emile nodded, his eyes drifting to the window where the rain danced. A slow smile touched his lips—unexpected, almost revolutionary. "Perhaps," he acknowledged softly. "But I've learned... it's okay to let go and feel the rain on my face again."

Their conversation lingered, spiraled by the subtle cadence of rain. It hinted at changes imperceptible yet profound, like a painter's touch adding layers to a canvas already vibrant with emotion.

For Emile, the rain was no longer a harbinger of gloom. It was a gentle reminder of the unending cycles of loss and discovery. The leash, once a symbol of sadness, began to transform into something new. It was a bridge between past and present, teaching him the bittersweet beauty of learning to embrace new joys amidst echoes of what once was.

As the rain continued to fall, it carried with it the promise of renewal. And in that promise, Emile found reflection, comforted by the enduring companionship of both Lena and the patient rhythm of the world outside his window.
