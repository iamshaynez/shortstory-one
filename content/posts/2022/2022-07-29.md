“James Atherton had never believed in ghosts,” said Inspector Mallory with a wry smile, “until they whispered his name in the alley.” His eyes gleamed with a curious mix of skepticism and intrigue. The narrow streets, cobbled and worn, seemed to lean inward, keeping secrets from the prying eyes of London's smog-swathed cityscape.

James, a gaunt figure draped in the weary garment of a middle-aged clerk, shuffled uneasily beside the inspector. “I swear, sir, it wasn’t the drink. It was...” His voice trembled, as though each word might summon the specters anew.

“Straight as milk you said?”

“Yes, sir, as straight as milk.”

“Don’t you mean as white as milk, Atherton?” Inspector Mallory’s eyebrow arched in mild amusement.

“No, sir—it’s what she said. The lady in the ghostly dress. Pale and ethereal. ‘As straight as milk,’ were her exact words. A riddle, most likely.”

The alley’s damp air seemed to draw them into its mysteries, closer to the edge of what was seen and what merely whispered at shadows. Around them, the buildings stood like silent witnesses, their brick facades glistening with the drizzle of London’s perpetual gloom. To the outsider, life in this part of the city moved with a Dickensian familiarity—where social iniquities wrapped themselves around the waking lives of its inhabitants like a thick fog, always present but rarely examined.

As they walked deeper into the heart of the alley, the city’s noises became muted, stilled as if by some unseen hand. The spectral aura enveloped them, layers of history rustling in the breeze. Inspector Mallory—an armchair philosopher much to the chagrin of his superiors—had seen his fair share of London’s strangeness, but this case posed a curious charm he couldn't resist.

“What did she, this... apparition, desire of you, Atherton?”

James paused, glancing down as though ashamed of his own imagination. “She spoke of injustices—a wrong to right. Like a Dickens' tale, full of shadows that aim to reform the light.”

“Indeed. And did she say how?”

“Nay, sir. Only that the whispers would guide and protect those who listen.”

Their footsteps echoed softly as they approached a dim corner where the alleged specter had been seen. Atherton’s hand, trembling despite the warm glove that covered it, gestured to the spot where reality seemed to blur with the ethereal.

As if on cue, a gust of wind sent a chill through the alley, and the rustle of unseen leaves whispered through them, a soft murmur like the sibilant urgency of an undiscovered truth.

Mallory turned sharply to James, whose face was alight with something resembling wonder—a sudden clarity that had only seemed possible within the clutches of fantasy.

"It's a sign, Inspector. She's asking us to see beyond the veil—to listen to the forgotten voices of our own lives."

Inspector Mallory considered this, his thoughts lingering on the delicate threads of Atherton's tale. Here, in these silent streets interwoven with life’s harsher truths, the spirit’s call for justice seemed less phantasmal and more a mirror.

In the heart of the city, tales of the supernatural mingled effortlessly with reality, each voice of yesteryear echoing alongside the shuffling of contemporary feet. The ghosts of the past served as the haunting reminder of an unchanged world. So perhaps Atherton's apparition carried a wisdom only few would heed: that to truly rectify our paths, we must listen, intently, to the whispers that pass unnoticed through life’s busiest alleys.

As the wind settled and the moment passed, Inspector Mallory found himself reflecting once more, turning Atherton’s encounter over like a puzzle both real and imagined—a riddle, as straight as milk.
