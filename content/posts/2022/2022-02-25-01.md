The dim glow of dusk filtered through the elaborate latticed windows of Mei's parlour, casting shadows on the dusty rose walls. Mei sat across from her younger self, an uncanny mirror image of a life she once led. The peculiar strands of time had curled back upon themselves, offering her a glimpse into what she could never alter—a life not truly hers anymore, yet undeniably marked by her past choices.

"I found this in your old jewelry box," Young Mei remarked, holding out a necklace—its rudimentary design seemed almost out of place amid the sophisticated room. “Why did you keep it?”

"My first gift," Mei replied, a wistful smile ghosting her lips. "A token from a man who once meant the world to me."

Young Mei examined the necklace, now a bridge between the present and her own imagined rebirth. "Do you regret?"

"A question asked before its answer can truly be understood." Mei's voice was a ripple on a mirror-like lake, hinting depths unseen. "In this world, as Eileen Chang once penned, our hearts beat with the rhythm of mundane elegance and cold allure."

The young girl's eyes were full of searching, seeking meaning where time appeared infinite. "But if you could change—"

Mei cut in softly, "Life is not woven from the threads of rebirth and endless chances, but from the fabric of what we do with the passions and failings we are given."

The silence that followed was like a gentle tide, lapping and retreating in the quiet dimness, punctuated only by the grandfather clock's steady thrum, much like the heart of time itself, moving ever forward, never backward.

A rustle at the door drew their attention—a figure loomed, silhouetted against the dim glow of the hallway. It was Jin, a man whose presence carried the weight of a thousand unsaid words and unshed tears.

Jin entered the parlour, his eyes meeting Mei's. "You wear the past like an heirloom, Mei. It will shadow every future you try to build."

"You were part of it, an indelible mark," Mei replied, her tone tinged with both bitterness and a reluctant fondness. "But we can never return, only move forward with what remnants we cherish or begrudge."

Their dialogue continued with the world shrinking to just these artisans of their own demise, the broader tapestry of their emotions laid bare in this secluded room. 

Unbeknownst to Young Mei, the older Mei knew the story was drawing to its preordained conclusion—a tragedy that left its bitter stain like a deep, unrelenting sorrow. But even in tragedy, there lay a beauty, a stark reflection of life's unpredictable cadence, resounding in Mei's parting words—a farewell to the specter of her own making.

"Do not mistake memory for salvation," said Mei, her voice now serene and resigned. "The necklace may be rough, but within its flawed contours holds the poetry of my life's decisions."

The parlour dimmed further as twilight encroached, the memories settled into their respective shadows. The room was silent, save for the unavoidable echo of what was, and perhaps what could never be.

Thus, the curtains fell upon Mei's final act—a life performed boldly, if not blamelessly. And with it, the young girl was left pondering the tragedy that was never meant for rewrites, only for understanding.

In the end, they embraced a silence heavy with the wisdom of love lost, and dreams fragmented like the necklace lying between them—its secrets known only to those who dared to dream of rebirth within a world bound by its own worldly elegance and cold allure.
