The city of Changxiang was a labyrinth of iron and glass, its veins pulsing with the monotony of daily life. Amidst this concrete jungle, Xiao Lin, a character who wore the invisible cloak of ordinarity with pride, grappled with an existential crisis brought on, bewilderingly enough, by a thermostat.

This was no ordinary thermostat, mind you. It was an artifact from the bygone era of 1980s technology, perpetually set to nineteen degrees Celsius, as immovable as the stoic expressions of Xiao Lin’s ancestors staring down from his living room portraits. In a world obsessed with the latest smart-home solutions, Xiao Lin’s thermostat was the embodiment of stubborn resilience—an unyielding relic of tradition.

"Xiao Lin, have you considered upgrading?" asked Mei, his perpetually pragmatic sister, sipping tea from the delicate porcelain cup that seemed more a part of her than her hand. Her eyebrows arched in synchronized skepticism as she stared at the offending device.

"The thermostat and I, we have an understanding," Xiao Lin mused, a peculiar smile playing on his lips. "It keeps things consistent in this chaotic world."

His friend Zhi, a self-proclaimed philosopher who moonlighted as an accountant, chuckled as he lounged on Xiao Lin’s sun-bleached sofa. “Consistency is just high-functioning monotony, my friend.”

Xiao Lin ignored him, a habit that had developed over years of experiencing Zhi's endless musings about the banality of life. He turned the conversation to more pressing matters—like the persistence of the nagging moisture in his bedroom that mirrored the ominous gloom of his thoughts.

“You see," Zhi tapped his temple theatrically, "Maybe your room is protesting this consistency. Perhaps it’s a sign to embrace change?”

“No,” Xiao Lin shrugged nonchalantly, “Perhaps it’s just condensation.”

Mei shook her head in that universal expression of familial exasperation, while Xiao Lin adjusted the sleeves of his faded sweater. “Some things never change, and that’s okay,” he declared, resolute as ever.

Yet, in the quiet solitude of night, Xiao Lin sometimes found himself wondering, staring at the thermostat’s unwavering dial. What if Zhi was right? What if this stubborn adherence to the past was like the city's unyielding grip on its people, a comfort yet a constraint?

One humid spring evening, as Xiao Lin stood contemplating his thermostat, a flicker of doubt crossed his mind. Did his affinity for this outdated device signify something greater—an acceptance of the predictable, the refusal to engage with the unpredictable dance of life? Or was it just a thermostat, one trivial element of his home among many?

Before he could peel back the layers of his speculation, the reality of existence caught up with him. The shrill ring of his phone interrupted the silence, a reminder of the city's incessant clamor. It was Mei, complaining about the rising cost of vegetables. Life’s practicalities always seemed to have a way of snapping him back from the precipice of introspection.

As he answered the call, the thermostat watched silently, its own purpose unwavering amidst their dialogue—a steadfast symbol of Xiao Lin’s modest defiance in the bustling cityscape of Changxiang.

Perhaps, someday, he would find an answer to his ponderings. Until then, life persisted in its paradoxical rhythm, leaving Xiao Lin and his thermostat precisely where they began—caught in the middle of tradition and progression, with no clear certainty, only whims and whispers.

And as the city buzzed around him, Xiao Lin smiled, for this uncertain journey, was just another beautiful absurdity of life.
