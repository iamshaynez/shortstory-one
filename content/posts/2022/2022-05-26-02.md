The inn was quiet that evening, waxing shadows clinging to the deepening corners. James leaned against the worn-out bar, fingers drumming the counter with the rhythm of a man who had seen too much. The room was stuffy, the fireplace flickering weakly. It had seen better days.

Sarah slid onto the stool beside him, setting down a small cooler with a gentle thud. "They didn't give you complete ice packs again, did they?" James nodded, a wry smile playing at the corner of his mouth. "Incomplete, as always. Just like this place."

"It's unsettling," Sarah whispered, her eyes scanning the shadows that seemed much darker tonight. "This inn, it's ...灵异, don't you think?"

The word hung in the air, foreign yet oddly comforting in how it explained the oddities around them. "Only explains part of it," James replied. "Sometimes a place just mirrors the fractures inside us."

Sarah opened her mouth, then paused, a simple gesture packing more emotion than a speech. The two sat in companionable silence, occasionally disrupted by groans of the old wood.

"How long have you been here, James?" she finally asked, curiosity laced with a slice of concern.

"Long enough to see things and know they can't be unseen," he replied in his signature Hemingway hard-boiled manner. His eyes, intense yet gentle, spoke the untold stories his lips refused to utter. 

They watched as a couple entered the inn, their laughter echoing like a soundtrack trying desperately to overlay over an ominous underscore. The chill embraced them immediately, and they drew closer, searching for warmth.

"Newcomers," Sarah noted. "Still full of hope."

"Poor souls," James commented, "only to find incomplete ice packs."

Their laughter was sardonic, the kind shared by people who understood life's twisted sense of humor. The inn seemed to react, its threads whispering secrets of ghosts long past and dreams still lingering.

As night deepened, the fire in the hearth gave a final puff of life before sputtering out. Sarah told stories of her childhood—all set in a sunlit village far from the inn and its spectral inhabitants. James listened, saying little but glancing at her with an expression that was tender beneath the façade.

"You ever think of leaving?" Sarah dared to ask, a hint of desperation masked by casual inquiry.

James shrugged. "Can you leave what resides inside you? The inn is incomplete, as we're living in the fragments of ourselves. It holds us right where we're meant to be."

"That's a grim thought," Sarah murmured, her fingers tracing the edges of the cooler. "Maybe we're just waiting."

"For what?"

Sarah smiled, a ghost of sadness in her eyes. "For the rest to catch up."

By dawn, the couple had checked out, leaving behind keychains and a sense of loss. James and Sarah stepped into the sour morning light, the bite of winter tangible against their skin. The inn stood resolute, its secrets weighted, anchored firmly in the folds of time.

As they walked away from the threshold, Sarah turned back. "Did you hear about the couple from this morning?"

James glanced briefly over his shoulder, a smirk playing across his lips. "They're destined to wander," he said, with the finality of a hard-boiled detective's case. "Incomplete ice packs and all."

Their laughter mingled with the cold air, carried away by the whispers of the unresolved. The inn, with its broken fidelity, stood as a testament to all things 灵异, embracing irony within its decrepit elegance—a narrative within the enclosure of its crumbling walls, complete in its incompleteness.
