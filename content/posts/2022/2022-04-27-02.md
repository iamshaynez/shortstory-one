Detective Charlotte Merriweather, a woman with sharp eyes and an even sharper wit, surveyed the room with a keen interest. Her presence commanded an air of assured calm, though a hint of mischief always lurked on her lips. The small, peculiar room was lined with seemingly ordinary items—paintings, a bookshelf, and a peculiar, square-shaped outlet that caught her attention almost immediately.

"That's an odd sight," remarked Arthur, the anxious homeowner who had summoned her. He was a middle-aged man with a fidgety manner, his fingers constantly at war with each other as he attempted to project an air of normalcy. His voice wavered towards uncertainty, "It's never looked like that before."

The room bristled with suspense as Charlotte probed further, her mind fixating on the unusual outlet like a reader enthralled by a gripping novel. "Tell me, Arthur, who else has access to this room?" she asked, her voice as smooth as velvet caressing a secret.

Arthur hesitated. "Just my wife, Irene, and our lodger, Ms. Green," he replied, eyes flitting towards the exit as though considering escape. 

Detective Merriweather nodded, her thoughts perpetually writing and rewriting the potential narratives unfolding in her mind. "And your wife, may I speak with her?" 

"Of course," Arthur breathed, as if relieved by the distraction.

Irene Merriweather entered with an elegance that spoke volumes; her demeanor radiated sophistication layered with an undercurrent of tension. Her eyes darted to the square outlet, as if recognizing an old adversary. "This outlet," she began, her voice betraying a hint of vexation, "It's been acting strangely ever since our lodger arrived."

"Ms. Green?" Merriweather inquired, her curiosity piqued. The detective's mind was a tumultuous sea of potential scenarios; Agatha Christie herself would have paused to admire its complexity.

"Yes," Irene affirmed, her lips tightening at the corners, signaling a controlled irritation. "She's peculiar, always tinkering with something."

As if summoned by the mention of her name, Ms. Green appeared—a woman of peculiar charm, with bright eyes reflective of restless curiosity. "I hear I'm the topic of discussion," she declared with a cordial yet challenging tone.

Charlotte nodded, presenting one of her patented smiles designed to disarm the most stubborn hearts. "Indeed, you've piqued my interest. Tell me, what do you know of this outlet?"

Ms. Green chuckled softly, her laughter a mysterious melody. "It's a relic from older times, back when my grandfather lived here. The square design was his innovation."

Intrigued, Merriweather leaned closer, her mind meticulously absorbing each word like a sponge of intrigue. "Does it have a purpose?"

"Oh yes," replied Ms. Green with an enigmatic twinkle. "It's a secret passage of sorts, a forgotten mechanism. My grandfather was a fond admirer of secrets."

The room held its collective breath as Merriweather's eyes gleamed with a newfound understanding. Like a master detective embracing her revelation, she said, "So, the outlet isn't just an outlet. It's the key to unraveling a much larger mystery."

Arthur and Irene exchanged glances of bewilderment and relief—the resolution slowly dawning upon them like the break of dawn through dense fog. "A secret passage," Arthur repeated, the nervous tremor in his voice replaced with genuine wonder.

Detective Merriweather threw back her head in laughter, the tension in the room dissolving like sugar in rain. "See, even the most peculiar mysteries can lead to rather unexpected resolutions."

As she bid her farewells, Merriweather felt the familiar thrill of discovery, leaving the household to reflect on the extraordinary nature of hidden truths revealed. An ordinary day transformed into an extraordinary adventure. Indeed, the mystery of the square outlet had been solved, closing the final chapter on yet another compelling tale worth its weight in storytelling gold.
