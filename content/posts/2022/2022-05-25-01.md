Elena sat in the corner of the dimly lit attic, her fingers tracing the sharp angles of a dusty box. The dolls inside, forgotten companions of long-lost childhoods, lay sprawled in silent conversation. Samuel, the melancholic seamstress with a penchant for forgotten narratives, joined her, his eyes catching the faint glint of a porcelain arm poking through the cluster.

"Why do you keep these dolls, Elena? They're just relics," Samuel mused, his voice a soothing lull against the chaos outside. The world teetered on the brink of an apocalypse—a fact that hung in the air between their stares. But here, in this sanctuary of memories and dust, time seemed irrelevant.

"Relics, perhaps. Yet they breathe stories, each with their own name," Elena replied, lifting a small, worn-out figure. "This one, Matilda, she used to belong to my grandmother. She whispered secrets to the moon."

Samuel chuckled softly. "Whispering dolls! You always had a thing for the uncanny, didn't you?"

The labyrinthine city outside, bathed in surreal twilight, was crumbling. Streets twisted in impossible angles, reflecting the chaos within the minds of those who roamed them. Order and meaning dissolved into this Borges-style maze of consciousness. Yet Elena found solace in organizing both tangible and intangible remnants.

"Do you remember when we first met?" Samuel asked, taking a seat beside her. "In that café down the curve of the main street—seemingly ordinary, yet like a version of Zeno's paradox: our meeting seemed to contain an infinity."

Elena nodded, a wistful smile touching her lips. "You said you admired how I saw beauty in the trivial, the remnants. Like these dolls."

A gentle breeze sifted through the cracked window, rustling yellowed newspapers that spoke of the world's end. They both knew the inevitable, yet here in the attic’s peculiar eternity, it seemed but an abstract concept.

"How do you think it all ends?" Samuel asked, toying with a tarnished locket, relic of his own past.

Elena pondered, staring into the vacant eyes of a doll whose story remained unknown. "Perhaps," she began, "it ends when we cease to find meaning amidst chaos. When we no longer see the magic in these unimportant dolls, then perhaps our world truly collapses."

"For us," Samuel countered, "that may never come, even if for the rest it ends tomorrow."

Their dialogue was disrupted by a sudden tremor, the attic shaking as if resenting their detachment from reality. Dust cascaded from the beams. They exchanged a glance, a shared understanding of fragility.

"Shall we step into the labyrinth then?" Samuel suggested with a gentle wave at the sprawling cityscape beyond.

Elena nodded, placing the doll back with care, as if fearing it might shatter in their absence. "Perhaps. But maybe... just for a final conversation."

Together, they descended, stepping out into the surreal tapestry of their altered city—a place where each path, each corner, carried a whisper of routes not taken and lives not lived. Amidst it, they felt anchored as they moved, two figures searching for meaning in a world that had misplaced its own.

In the end, as the city and time converged, they found their meaning not in saving the world, but in preserving small stories—their forgotten dolls. Perhaps this, Elena mused, this moment in the labyrinth, was the real story. In an apocalyptic world, it was the trivialities that gave it shape.

And so, in this unexpected structure where each turn could be an end or a beginning, Samuel and Elena wandered, wrapped in a timeless conversation, unseeing of the world's end but keen to uncover the stories yet untold.
